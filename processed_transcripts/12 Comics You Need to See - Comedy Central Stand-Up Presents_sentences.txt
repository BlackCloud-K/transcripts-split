1. will miles y'all with hpv Felt like a weird icebreaker, I like it
2. What if you do
3. A 30 you do, statistically
4. I feel good
5. I don't have it, I don't think
6. If you were wondering
7. I feel pretty good
8. My weight fluctuates a lot, so it's good, I feel good
9. I don't know, I go anywhere from like 150 to 250 on a given day
10. Anybody else like that
11. No
12. Just me
13. I can't tell
14. It gets so bad now that my weight has become a measure of time
15. Like, I saw a friend of mine, another comedian
16. His name is Big Keef
17. He's obviously a black comedian
18. And I hadn't seen him in years, and I walked over
19. I saw him, and he saw me at a comedy club
20. He was like, damn, I ain't seen you since you was fat, skinny, and then fat again
21. I was like, hey, you could have just said, like, three years, man
22. This is kind of a hurtful way to do it, but whatever
23. I do commercials a lot, so it helps that I'm chubby every now and then
24. I'm black, curly hair, chubby, so obviously I go into commercials where it's like, mm, this tastes good
25. Is this just a burger
26. This is different than a burger
27. This got bacon on it
28. So I go into auditions, and that's usually what I do, where I walk in and then pretend to try a burger and then move forward
29. Sometimes, though, I go in auditions and they have no words at all
30. They'll be like, can you just show us how you smile
31. And then I walk in, I go
32. Because I forget what part they want me for, but I want the part of the small little white girl in the commercial
33. Because that looks so much fun
34. I want that role
35. I know why we're in this mess
36. I've identified the culprit
37. There's one source of the decay of human civilization, and that is a particular trend in home decor
38. Now, some of you have this up in your house right now, and what it is is inspirational quotes on rustic pieces of driftwood in multiple fonts
39. You know what I'm talking about
40. Now, as we know, for the quote to go on the rustic piece of driftwood, it must feature one of the key words
41. If it doesn't have one of these key words in the quote, it's not inspirational enough
42. Do not put it on wood
43. Don't waste our time
44. Those words include journey, faith, hope, sister, live, laugh
45. Love
46. You know what I'm talking about
47. Kitchen
48. The whole set is me just listing the words
49. The whole show is just this
50. Wine
51. Blessed
52. Believe
53. Believe
54. Believe is so powerful
55. It's so potent
56. It can live by itself on a piece of driftwood
57. Some people don't even put it on wood
58. Some people just tattoo it on the front of their neck, and that's a choice
59. But how does it work
60. Like, if you need a sign to remind you to laugh, are you all right
61. You go through your house and you see it, and you're like, oh, I almost forgot
62. Like, talk to someone
63. You are not okay
64. I always do feel a little bit bad when I tell that joke
65. Because there's usually at least one woman's face in the crowd just dissolving off her head
66. She's just like, oh no
67. That's me
68. Yeah, you could get away with whatever you want if you have a cute accent
69. But I think the opposite is true if you have a thick, regional, American accent
70. Then you can't get away with anything because everyone thinks you're dumb as shit
71. And it's super unfair, you know
72. Like, I grew up in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, which has a very trashy accent
73. And it's so unfair because there are people in Pittsburgh with that accent who are very, very smart
74. But are they
75. I don't know
76. It's kind of hard to buy sometimes, you know
77. Yeah, it's very hard to buy sometimes
78. Even the people in Pittsburgh who are in positions where you know just to get there, they have to be smart
79. Like, imagine being in a courtroom in Pittsburgh, and the judge walks in, looking very distinguished, wearing the robe, and then he sits down and opens his mouth and says, okay, so nobody freak out or nothing, but, uh
80. Jurors deliberated and concluded, defendant's guilty beyond reasonable doubt
81. You'd be like, uh, are you sure
82. Can we put you in jail
83. Is that an option to put the judge in jail
84. The reason I say is because the way you talk makes it sound like you've maybe stabbed someone over a sausage argument
85. This guy's trying to fricking tell me kill bosses, not top five sausage
86. What am I supposed to do, not shank them
87. Fricking get out of here
88. That's how people talk in Pittsburgh
89. And sausage is like a top priority for most of the people I grew up with in Pittsburgh
90. I like to do drugs because they made me feel good
91. One thing I like to do when I'm really bored is I like to get really high
92. And then I like to go to that Google Maps
93. and I go to the street view and I just drive
94. See what's out there in that great big world of ours, you know
95. Put a little desk fan there, feel the wind in my hair
96. Really live, you know
97. I do smoke weed, but I don't wake and bake
98. I woke and coke
99. really gets the eight ball rolling, you know
100. Do you guys know this
101. Back in the day, they actually used to put cocaine in Coca-Cola
102. Do you know you still can
103. That's what you call a Coca-Cola classic
104. My last girlfriend won our breakup
105. If you guys are thinking, Charles, breakups aren't a thing you can win or lose, that's true, but also, grow up
106. This is how you win a breakup
107. You move on first, that's like 80 points
108. You start dating somebody new, that's like 200 points
109. And then you post pictures of you and that new person getting cocktails at the bar in the Ace Hotel
110. And then it's game over, you win, Kate
111. I was looking at my ex-girlfriend's Instagram profile the other day, which, by the way, is how you lose a breakup
112. She's at the Ace Hotel with the new guy, tag the Ace Hotel, tag the new guy
113. I start looking at the new guy's profile
114. And everything in my body is telling me to hate him
115. Everything is saying, hate this man
116. But
117. he had an awesome summer
118. He killed it last summer, and I can't take that away from the guy
119. He went to Coachella both nights
120. had a bunch of barbecues on rooftops, went kayaking with his best friend Mike
121. I started looking at Mike's profile
122. Mike, I couldn't really get on board with
123. He was a little too bro-y for me
124. But he did take time out 27 weeks ago to go to his sister's graduation
125. Allow me now to say congratulations, Christina
126. She graduated from the University of Minnesota with a degree in English
127. With her best friend Margaret
128. I started looking at Margaret's profile
129. If there's anything I can tell you about Margaret, it's that she loves to party and she loves her dog
130. I started looking at Margaret's dog's profile
131. And then I accidentally liked one of Margaret's dog's photos
132. And I was just like, oh, shit
133. Like, could they trace this all the way back to me
134. So I unliked it
135. But then I remembered, if you like something and then you unlike it, they can see that you liked it and that you unliked it
136. Yes, it's true
137. Sorry, but you are busted
138. Now you know, don't do it again
139. Yeah, they can see it
140. So I decided, you know what
141. I'm just gonna like it
142. Because if I'ma go out, I'ma go out like a G
143. And that's when I realized I'd been sitting on the toilet for two hours
144. And it was time to get back to work
145. I got engaged when I was 21
146. Isn't that stupid
147. That's some Indiana shit, man
148. Everybody on the coast is like, I'm 59, I'm still young
149. In Indiana, if you're not married by 26, you're legally gay
150. It's up
151. You're not allowed to vote or use the bathroom or whatever
152. I got engaged so young, it didn't work out
153. She ended up cheating on me while we lived together, which was a bummer, but it did give me the opportunity to pack angrily, which was interesting
154. You ever pack angrily
155. Not your best packing work
156. I was unpacking like, oh, I took the oven knobs
157. That was a weird move, okay
158. Got backups, that's good
159. Oh, you've taken a new lover
160. Well, I took the microwave door
161. Who wins
162. I took the paper towels
163. That's true, I took a half roll of paper towels
164. I left my laptop and I took my paper towels
165. I was like, you're not gonna wipe up his with these
166. Those are mine
167. You get your own damn towels
168. I'm in my 30s and I have my first boyfriend ever
169. That's a big deal
170. It's a big deal
171. My mom's super excited about it
172. She calls me every day, and she's all, do you still have a boyfriend
173. Do you still have a boyfriend
174. And I'm like, yes, he's still my boyfriend
175. We're still good
176. And her second question is always, are you pregnant yet
177. Are you pregnant yet
178. You're not
179. Well, maybe you need to go get checked because I read an article that women who eat a lot of chicken nuggets, they can't have babies anymore because of the chicken nuggets
180. No, seriously, truly, scientists have scientifically studied And they found that the chicken nuggets mess up down there real bad
181. And well, you know, I don't want to name names, but you eat a lot of chicken nuggets
182. I'm like, yeah, these are facts
183. But then I thought about it
184. And if it is true, and chicken nuggets do prevent pregnancy, that's awesome
185. Right
186. Right
187. Then I could just pick up a 20 piece for the month
188. You know what I mean
189. Pop a nug every day
190. If you skip a day, two nugs the next day
191. What
192. I'm already eating chicken nuggets all the time
193. Now I'm preventing pregnancy, too
194. You know, simultaneously, it's awesome
195. It's awesome
196. And you bet your ass you still gotta dip them, because that's what activates it
197. The barbecue and the honey mustard make the babies not grow
198. My boyfriend's like, should I wear a condom
199. And I'm like, pfft
200. Nah, man
201. I ate double the chicken nuggets this month
202. Let them fly
203. I'm bad at sex
204. So are most of you, though
205. That's how being good at stuff works
206. For every one LeBron James, there's a hundred of this guy
207. No disrespect, sir, I just don't think you can bang in the post like that
208. I get annoyed
209. Everybody hypes up sex
210. I think that we should glorify our other qualities
211. I have other great qualities
212. I'm an incredible friend
213. How come that never comes up when I have my dick in my hand
214. It's not the in and out of sex I'm bad at
215. I understand that
216. It's a pretty simple move
217. My issue with sex is that I'm bad at multitasking
218. I'm not a good multitasker
219. That's not the way that God made me
220. Like, I was having sex with a woman
221. She was real
222. I was having sex with her, and she wanted me to talk dirty
223. She was like, talk dirty to me
224. And I was like, no
225. We've been talking all night
226. I was so good at talking
227. You let me have sex with you
228. Can I shut the up for 15 minutes
229. 10 minutes
230. Five minutes, don't joke
231. She made me keep going though
232. She was like, just say something, say something mean
233. Be mean
234. And I was like, I don't want to
235. And she was like, be mean
236. And I was like, okay, it smells in here
237. I think that your cat is sick and that we should have gone to Maya Park
238. She didn't take that, though
239. She didn't take it
240. Can you believe that
241. She wouldn't take it
242. She was like, just be loose
243. Be free
244. Just say whatever's crossing your mind
245. I'm like, I'm a weird guy
246. You don't want that
247. And she was like, just do whatever
248. So I did
249. And I yelled, hold the flaps back, mama
250. I'm trying to get wiggly
251. So, you know, we're getting married
252. There's too many humans in New York
253. There's too many humans
254. 8
255. 5 million people live in 300 square miles
256. Why
257. If you break that down, that's 27,000 people per mile
258. How do you live
259. Whose idea was this
260. y'all just strapped two islands together with some bridges and was like, oh, y'all got to see this
261. No
262. And God forbid one of these Yankees finds out I'm not from New York
263. Oh, you're not from New York
264. They all sound like witches to me
265. You're not from New York
266. What do you mean you're not from New York
267. No, through the grace of God, I was not born here, thank you
268. where are you from
269. Atlanta, you're welcome
270. Like, oh, you must be so glad to be in New York
271. The South is so racist
272. The South is so racist
273. Oh, you mean the part of the South that starts at Canada ends at Mexico
274. Find me a part of America that's not racist
275. I'll move today
276. I'll wait
277. I know the North is more racist because in the North, they split up white folks
278. They got Italian neighborhoods, Irish neighborhoods
279. I live in a Greek neighborhood
280. You know what Irish and Italian and Greek is in the South
281. White
282. Nobody has time to break down your brand of whiteness, okay
283. I don't care what flag your Caucasian flies under, Brandon
284. Go vote and sit the hell down
285. What do you want from me
286. I'll tell you what is not flirting, and that is catcalling
287. This is a message, all right
288. It happened to me recently because I am adorable
289. And, you know, so I'm walking, walking down the street, and this dude, he's just like, hey
290. He's like, where you going
291. And I was very frustrated because again, adorable
292. And so I just turned around and I was like, home, I'm just going home
293. And he just kind of looked me up and down and he was like, home
294. Okay, well, be safe
295. And I was like, what the
296. who wrote that cat call
297. Are you M
298. Night Shyamalan
299. Like, that was a twist ending
300. Like, my titties were out
301. What are you doing
302. Like, did you just respect me
303. Like, what
304. That is not how this was supposed to end
305. I feel like teachers are celebrities, but we don't treat them as such
306. They are
307. You're welcome
308. They are
309. We don't treat them as such
310. Celebrities
311. They molded our lives
312. That's why we sit in these seats today, man
313. We know our first grade teacher
314. We remember our kindergarten teacher
315. We remember them
316. You know how they celebrities, you remember you was little, you see your teacher out in public, you freak out
317. You're like, Mr
318. Burnley, what you doing out here with shorts on
319. Why you got your ankles out
320. What the you doing
321. Oh, I'm just going to the beach
322. No, you live in school
323. I ain't never seen you outside
324. What you doing outside
325. Never thought they had they own life
326. When I was little, man, I thought my teacher, at the end of the day, just go back into the cubby and recharge
327. All right, it's 8
328. 30
329. How you doing, class
330. Oh, I knew he was back there
331. He never leaves
332. I do, I love, like, learning, like, about sciences, learning about tech, stuff like that
333. One of my favorite things to do is to research which animals are gay
334. You know, giraffes, bias
335. Something about the neck, we don't know
336. But there's not that much research done about which bugs are gay, right
337. And I've looked it up, I've done some of my own, and they said that sometimes two male bugs will mistake each other for a female and accidentally have sex
338. And it's like, okay, I went to college
339. So I made a slide that's a very comprehensive list of which bugs are gay or not, so let's go
340. Dragonflies, the fact that dragonflies will just hover in air perfectly still like that, not moving, gay
341. Their choir is classical training, you know
342. Like, they went to drama school
343. Ladybugs, every ladybug is a lesbian
344. Honestly
345. Look, they got this bold lipstick right here, but if you zoom in, there's Birkenstocks on every one of these
346. Beatles, lesbians, that's a strap
347. Bees, the fact that you're so willing to hurt someone that you would die for it, that's gay
348. Like, the pettiness that that takes, very gay
349. And they worship a queen, like, come on, you know
350. Wasps are straight
351. It's a visceral feeling
352. I don't need to explain it
353. We all get it
354. And look at that interior design
355. You know, like, it's just not up to par
356. Butterflies, gay
357. I mean, come on
358. You know, they go in the cocoon, college, they pop out, they start that, and, you know, classic queer narrative
359. Cicadas, the fact that they just, like, take off their clothes and leave it anywhere, that's straight, you know
360. It's like, pick up after yourself, cicadas
361. Gay
362. Every praying mantis is gay as look
363. Like, yes
364. Let's get these aphids
365. Scorpions, are they insects
366. Are they spiders
367. Neither, they're bi
368. Cockroaches are gay because they're everywhere and you'll never get rid of them
369. Ants, with ants it's like, you're working so hard
370. what are you hiding
371. I just think ants need to do some soul searching
372. And Zeddy Longlegs gay
373. And that is a complete list of all the bugs that are gay
374. I know because I them all
