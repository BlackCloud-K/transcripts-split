1. Like, I'm from South Philly
2. Uh, I'm from South Philly
3. You know what I hate
4. I hate the fact that when I say that now, no one gives a shit anymore
5. Back in the day, you say you from South Philly, people would be like, oh, he's from South Philly, Hajiwala
6. Hajiwala
7. This guy's dangerous
8. Now you say it, it's like, oh, oh, South Philly's a nice place
9. On the gentrification, due to gentrification, it's nice now
10. And some of y'all are like, oh, he's about to complain about people moving it
11. I'm not
12. I don't care that much
13. My dad owns this house
14. So I don't care
15. Uh
16. That sounds so selfish, but it's the truth
17. All right, now, the thing is, with justification, I'm not angry at people moving in
18. I'm angry that it's going to ruin the stories for my kids
19. Like, I don't want to be talking to my kids, be walking down the street, and I'm like, yo, see that house right there
20. Crack all day
21. That's where they sell crack at
22. Next to the muffin stand
23. It wasn't a muffin stand
24. It was crack
25. They give me two chocolate chip muffins
26. These kids got to learn
27. Thing is, a lot of people say in the hood, well, people say that you gotta vote so you can change everything in the hood, make it better
28. It's dumb, you know what I mean
29. No president should be tweeting
30. None
31. But his tweets
32. He tweets at North Korea like he been beefing with them for like five years and they live around the corner
33. Those same tweets, if you work at Applebee's, you're like, I'm gonna leave this one in the drafts
34. Like, that might lose my job, you know what I mean
35. He's like, no, fuck that, I'm the president
36. He sends out tweets
37. North Korea, if I see you, I'm going to slap the shit out you
38. Swear to God, hashtag free smoke
39. You're the president
40. You can't use free smoke
41. You can't use it
42. I'm not going to be surprised tonight if we go to bed and wake up and just eat a dick
43. That's what he tweets
44. That's the whole tweet
45. No context
46. It's everybody
47. The president doesn't give a fuck, dude
48. It's awful
49. I see, okay, let's just say, you become a great-grandparent, right
50. One day, you're with your grandchild
51. You're helping them with their homework, their history homework
52. You get to number three, and number three reads, what was the tweet that started the war
53. And who was the president that tweeted
54. You're gonna be like, eh, that guy made some good points that last time
55. It's just what it is, man
56. You know what's funny
57. Like, I look at this day and age now, and everybody's, like, running around, getting your 23andMe done
58. You know what I mean
59. Your DNA test
60. If you don't know what that is, they send you a DNA test
61. You send your DNA back, and you just trust it
62. That's it
63. You just trust it
64. They send you back a piece of paper
65. That's what you do
66. You give them your DNA
67. They give you back some paper
68. I mean, you still hide your Social Security number, because that's important to you
69. Sometimes when you're social, you get real quiet
70. Bunch of DNA
71. I'll send it to some random dude I never met
72. That makes fucking sense
73. I'm sorry
74. Maybe it's because I grew up poor
75. I just don't trust that shit
76. No, hell no
77. I'm not sending my DNA to some random person
78. Oh, it's a 23 in me
79. People get all excited
80. They get their little paperback
81. You know what I mean
82. They start crying
83. Oh, I thought I was all Scottish
84. Come to find out I'm half Jamaican
85. No, the fuck you're not
86. You're not half Jamaican
87. Whoever stood it off the pages, they just letting them shit, they just making them rain
88. They don't give a fuck what envelope they going in
89. Think they really care
90. They just got a job
91. I just got hired, fuck them
92. He's Jamaican, you know what I mean
93. White dudes in Brooklyn just saying, hey, wagwan, what the fuck is wrong with you, Jeff
94. What are you doing
95. Get off the back of your leg before you get the shits left on you
96. Nah, brethren, check out the paperwork
97. You know what's funny
98. If the ancestry people, when the 23andMe people get together, they are cloning all you motherfuckers
99. When I say that joke, people get a little tight
100. They're like, oh, man, fuck, he got a good point
101. I did register for both of those
102. I'm fucked
103. And some people are like, he's just being dramatic
104. You say that until you end up at one of those big box buildings or a convenience store, and you're serving you
105. You go, oh, this is weird
106. Hi, me
107. Yeah, motherfucker
108. Yeah, they cloned the shit out of you
109. You did the hand surgery, didn't you
110. Yep, they got me good
111. All 23andMe is is like Carfax with DNA
112. It just shows you all this shit that could be, you know what I mean
113. And if you had a previous owner, that's for black people
114. That's that
