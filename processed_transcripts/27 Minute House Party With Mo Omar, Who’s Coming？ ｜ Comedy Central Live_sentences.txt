1. Hi, my name is Moe
2. I'm from Wales
3. This is what we look like now
4. It's global warming
5. We've had to adapt
6. I'm from Cardiff
7. And basically, it's a nice place
8. It's the capital city of Wales
9. Great, beautiful city
10. I went to school there
11. I went to a good school, my mom thought
12. She sent me to a predominantly white school
13. That's how she thought it was good
14. But she made a mistake
15. It was poor white
16. Like, she didn't recognize it
17. It was two buses away
18. I had to go there every day
19. Just outside, right on the edge
20. And it was the kind of school where, it was a good school
21. It was the kind of school where, like, the dreams were big, but the windows were plastic
22. Did you guys know
23. Like, predominantly white, though
24. Predominantly white
25. She was right on that
26. Like, there were only two black kids in my school
27. There was my cousin, Saeed
28. And his mom copied my mom
29. And there was Fuad
30. You might notice my name is missing off that list
31. I wasn't cool enough to be black in my school
32. I got demoted to Asian
33. uh no i can say that all my friends are asian and they're all doing much better in life than me all right like my one friend rahan he's studying nuclear engineering at university yeah yeah yeah but he's a pakistani muslim studying nuclear engineering so you know i'll never let him leave like he has more money than me but i can go on holiday that's what i'm saying No, it's great
34. It's great
35. Rohan is the best of my friends
36. Not my best friend, just the best of my friends
37. He's like, he's the best
38. Like, puberty hit
39. He got attractive
40. We never told him
41. So we could keep him
42. Do you guys have this
43. Like, you have an attractive person in your group that you can keep to get into places, but you never let them know
44. It's like having a baby elephant so you can chain it up when it's young
45. And then when it gets big, you can ride it around town
46. Yeah
47. Rohan was that elephant
48. Like, our first ever house party, I wasn't even invited
49. Rohan was
50. But he got invited by the popular girl
51. We told him he'll never be loved
52. I got to go
53. That's how it works
54. It was an OK party
55. It was smart casual
56. That was the dress code
57. So I wore a vest, and he wore a blazer
58. But they were from the same three-piece suit, all right
59. So we looked like a unit, you know
60. And then we turned up to this girl's house
61. Now, this girl was posh
62. We didn't realize how posh she was until we arrived
63. We got to this girl's house
64. We got to the front
65. We got to the house
66. But get this, that's not where the house started
67. Yeah
68. Do you guys get that
69. Like, the house was here, but the house house, the house house was way over there
70. Like, you go to my house, you take two steps in
71. You're in my neighbor's house
72. It was a good house party
73. She showed us around, showed us to the back
74. She had three conservatories, or conservatoires, I suggested
75. And she told me to shut up, that I wasn't invited
76. So we carried on
77. First ever house party, we get in, OK
78. First conservatory, there's eight people sat there
79. And it's not exactly like I imagined, I'll be honest
80. Because all my ideas of house parties were from that TV show, Skins
81. Yeah, do you guys remember that
82. So I thought it was going to be like sex, drugs, someone would turn up with a baby
83. That's where season two kicks off
84. Like, that's what I thought it was going to be like
85. But we get there
86. It's just eight people sat in a circle
87. They're all kind of playing this like, you know, depression Olympics, like this victim Olympics
88. Very middle class problems
89. So they're all like, they're all like, oh, my parents, you know, they've split up because they were together first
90. You guys know
91. Or
92. Or they were like, oh, you know, my dad didn't buy me FIFA because she knew her dad
93. See, that's
94. Or she was like, this one girl was like, oh, my boyfriend got hit by a bus
95. She won
96. But you should have heard her talking
97. I think he jumped
98. Like, that's
99. It's not true
100. It's not true
101. But it was great
102. It was all right
103. We stayed there for 27 minutes
104. Honestly, I really resent it, because I stopped being Muslim to drink, all right
105. Yeah, yeah, figure that one out, all right
106. What a Faustian bargain that was
107. Because now, I feel like I've completed drinking, and I'm finished
108. Like, there's nowhere to go from here
109. And you can't go backwards drinking
110. Have you tried
111. Have you tried to go backwards
112. It's horrible
113. Like, I tried to buy a Lamborghini recently
114. Got diabetes
115. Straight away
116. Straight away
117. They just amputated in the shop
118. That was it
119. You can't
120. You can't go backwards
121. But I'll tell you this, OK
122. My grandmother would always say, you have to carry on forward
123. That's the only thing you can do
124. You can only carry on forward
125. She had all these phrases, my grandmother
126. Very wise woman
127. She used to say stuff like, a wash pot never kettles
128. Dementia
129. We didn't know, right
130. But she had all these other, she had all these beautiful phrases
131. She always used to say, you should love what you do, which is how I got into this
132. She always used to say to me, show me the rich man who is happy, and then take his money
133. That's the pirate life, guys
134. Guys, thank you very much
135. I've been Mo Omar
136. Cheers
