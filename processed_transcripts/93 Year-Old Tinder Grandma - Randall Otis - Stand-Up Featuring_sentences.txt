1. What's up, Negroes
2. How you guys doing
3. Hell yeah
4. Dude, I'm breaking barriers in my life
5. I had sex using a vibrator for the first time, and
6. by God, it's better
7. I thought I had good stuff
8. No, the hardware has improved phenomenally
9. It's, like, it was so good
10. Like, now when I show up to sex with my analog penis
11. it feels like bringing a horse and buggy to the Daytona 500
12. She's looking at me, takes off my pants, like, oh, nigga, you Amish
13. What the fuck
14. We have technology
15. You know what's weird, though, is even though it was my first time, it felt oddly familiar
16. Like, what it reminded me of is when I was a kid and I'd be holding the flashlight while my dad fixed the pipes
17. I was like, I don't feel like I'm a vital part of this process
18. But I'm glad you want me here
19. Have you come yet, Dad
20. " Yeah, that's the weird part of the show
21. It's been a big year for me sexually
22. I'm asking for stuff I want
23. It's not huge, but, you know, it's a big step for me
24. Like, I was hooking up with somebody
25. We've been hooking up for a while, and I went up to her
26. I was like, hey, I was wondering if you wanted to shake things up tri-anal, you know
27. And she was like, yes, but one condition
28. I get to do it to you, too
29. And I was like
30. Finally
31. Oh, my God
32. Yes
33. Yes
34. Look, dude, I'm from a small, conservative town
35. You know, you don't get the chance to experiment that much
36. This is my fucking time, baby
37. But I admit, I was nervous, because, like, I'll be real, like, I'm not super experienced
38. Like, I've had a finger around my butt
39. I've had someone go two knuckles deep
40. But, brother, an entire dildo in your ass
41. now we're cooking
42. That is phenomenal
43. Oh, my God
44. There's some guys in here looking at me weird, and you're wrong, all right
45. You're wrong, and you're scared
46. You have no idea
47. We're playing different games
48. You're playing checkers
49. I am playing Elden Ring, okay
50. Holy shit
51. I was so into it, I forgot she was even there
52. She's like, what about me
53. I'm like, it's not about you anymore, all right
54. I am learning about myself
55. Bro, it was so good, it's why I'm for universal health care now, honestly
56. It changed me politically
57. You're a man, you turn 45, you gotta get a prostate exam every year
58. I think every man should have this experience and the government should pay for it
59. It's my 2024 campaign
60. Bro, I'd be in the doctor's office every week like, what if I'm sick
61. Do your job, medicine man, you went to school for this
62. where I've been on strike for, like, the past five months, and, yeah, we won
63. It was pretty good, but
64. I'll admit, though, by, like, month two, I started getting real bored
65. I was starting to do some real freaky shit
66. I was watching the news live like a pervert
67. Nah, dude, I was watching the news, and they were talking about mass shootings
68. This is where the show gets fun
69. And this is how I know, like, gun rights people are running out of arguments
70. They said, the reason we have so many mass shootings in this country, it's not because of guns
71. Fuck off
72. No
73. It's because of rap music
74. Hip-hop is inspiring these young people to go out and commit atrocities
75. And I'm like, bro, have you heard modern rap
76. These are the biggest pussies on the planet
77. Like
78. Bro, the biggest rapper in the world is Drake, all right
79. I don't know about you, but I am not scared of a mass shooter inspired by Drake, okay
80. Straight up
81. I am not the toughest guy in the world at all, but if a Drake-inspired shooter came in this room right now, I could shut that shit down with a hard, stop it
82. And he'd just be like, I don't know what I'm doing
83. I'm sorry
84. You know, light skinned his way out of the room
85. He wouldn't even be able to begin
86. He would have dropped the gun from his overly moisturized hands before he even started
87. It's just like, I don't know, bro
88. Like rap's different now
89. Everyone's sad and on Xanax
90. You know, it's not the 90s anymore
91. It's just different now
92. countries in disarray
93. Arrested my boy
94. They arrested Trump for January 6th and like 97 other things
95. That's fucking crazy
96. I know crack dealers who've been arrested last
97. That's wild
98. It's hard for me, because I'm split on the issue
99. Because on one hand, I'm very progressive
100. But on the other, I am from Florida, so part of me wants him to beat the case, just a little bit
101. Just a little part of me
102. The progressive side of me is like, he should rot in jail for the rest of his life
103. And the Florida part of me is like, steal the bailiff's gun
104. Come on, Donnie
105. Don't let him hold you down, Donnie
106. He's inspiring, though, you know
107. He's like the Martin Luther King for white people with Facebook accounts
108. And I get it
109. Like, I grew up in a, like, pretty conservative area
110. I get how conservatives think, you know
111. Like, January 6th
112. Makes sense, right
113. I'm not saying politically
114. I just mean emotionally, I see how you could get to that point, because, like, you have to put it into context
115. January 6th, that happened during the pandemic, right
116. I don't know what your pandemic was like, but I live alone, because I'm really rich
117. And
118. That was just a year of me losing my mind by myself
119. And if someone came to my door during that time and was like, hey, man, me and some friends are gonna go murder the vice president
120. I would be like, you had me at friends
121. Honestly, like, I just need a group activity
122. Can't we play Uno
123. Now, dude, he's really inspiring these
124. Do you know how much you have to inspire somebody to get them to take a cross-country Greyhound bus to murder someone
125. I've never reached that level of desperation
126. Like, bro, Greyhound fucking sucks
127. I don't even think they wanted to riot initially
128. I think they just got on that bus and it radicalized them on the way to D
129. C
130. Bro, Greyhound sucks so much ass, dude
131. I was on Greyhound three weeks ago, and there was a guy just masturbating in the back, openly
132. And that was me, and I'm a good person
133. So imagine what everybody else in that bus was doing
134. We got anyone in therapy
135. I can tell this was a rich audience
136. Those are out of network, too
137. Those are carefree woos
138. I can hear it
139. Yeah, I'm in therapy
140. I've been going for, like, a year and a half
141. It rocks
142. It's funny, because, like, all my friends suggested I go
143. Like, it wasn't my idea
144. Which is how you know you're fucking killing it
145. And apparently I have clinical depression, which was news to me, because I always just thought I was chill, but
146. turns out you can be medically chill
147. Life-threateningly chill
148. It's funny, too, my friend, he also has clinical depression, but the thing is, my friend's 6'5", so it's not the same
149. I don't want to be a bitch, but, like, fuck tall people, okay
150. I'm 5'9", dude
151. I'm so jealous of tall people, it's just hard for me to care about their problems
152. Like, my friend, he'll come to me, he's like, yeah, man, I'm going through a lot of issues
153. I'm like, yeah, bro, just step over them
154. What are you talking about
155. But I was talking to my therapist, and I was like, what's, like, an actionable way for me to feel better about myself
156. And she's like, go out and help somebody else in your life
157. And I'm like, that's some Facebook-level advice, but OK
158. And I was talking to my grandma
159. My grandma, she's 93 years old
160. And yeah, she's killing it
161. Great woman
162. And she's a widow
163. Grandpa passed away a few years ago
164. But recently, on one of our calls, she told me that she's back out here on the dating scene, 93
165. Yeah
166. So, my man, if you're trying to join the family, you know what I'm talking about
167. Open slot
168. You don't have to wear condoms
169. I'm kidding, Jesus
170. You should definitely wear condoms
171. She's riddled with STDs
172. Look, it's called living a life
173. No, but I was talking to her, and she said she's nervous of getting back out there on the apps, mostly because I don't think Tinder goes that high
174. But I was like, yo, I'm a fuckboy piece of shit, you know
175. Like, I can lend you my services, and she accepted, so now I'm out here trying to get my grandma some dick
176. And the second weirdest part about that is that I had to have a conversation with her about what she's looking for in a man, which I never thought I'd have to do
177. And she told me she's only looking for two things
178. One, they have to be rich
179. And I'm like, girl, fair
180. Honestly, like, you're 93
181. This is the closest to reparations you are ever gonna get
182. Also, that's my inheritance
183. Now this is a business decision for me
184. " And then she said, too, that she's not looking for anything long-term
185. I'm like, bitch, you are 93
186. How much confidence do you have
187. Our conversations are long-term
188. So it turns out my grandma's also a fuckboy, just runs in our family like depression
189. But I did it
190. I set up a profile, which is just black and white pics she gave me from the 50s
191. We're out here catfishing senior citizens as a family
192. And I'm swiping
193. I land on this guy Alan's profile, and Alan's cool, dude
194. Like, we vibe
195. I tell him all the movies I like
196. He tells me all the injections he needs to make it through the week, you know
197. Cute first day stuff
198. And eventually I ask him out
199. He says, yeah
200. And he and my grandma, they've been going out for like a few months now
201. Nah, fuck her
202. Because Alan's my man, okay
203. She didn't earn that
204. She doesn't know Alan like I do
205. So she's out there with the love of my life, and I'm with you fucking people
206. But you guys have been great
207. Enjoy the rest of the show
208. Bye
