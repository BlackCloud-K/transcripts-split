1. You guys are way too sweet, man
2. You guys are way too sweet
3. So tonight, I want to start off talking about something a little important, right
4. Something that I think applies to a lot of us
5. It's a popular topic today
6. Feminism
7. But with a little bit of a twist tonight, right
8. Feminism
9. for men
10. Yeah, sorry, ladies, you know
11. But, like, for real, sorry
12. Okay, so, like, yes, you know, like, men can be feminists, right
13. Like, my bro's always like, Chad, how can you be a feminist if you're always trying to get girls, you know
14. And I'm like, whoa, don't mansplain me
15. Chill
16. And if you guys don't mind, I'd love to share a really quick anecdote with you, if that's cool
17. So I was pledging at ASU Go Devils, and
18. I noticed, like, when I was sitting down to pee, I was getting drunk a lot, I was, like, sitting down to pee, and noticed, like
19. something, like, wrong, you know
20. But it turns out, no, that's just the beginning stages of male feminism, everybody
21. Happens to everybody
22. Okay, so, what is feminism, right
23. That's a question that's on everybody's mind, and only Lena Dunham really seems to know the answer, so
24. I'd love to, like, just, also, before I start this part of the show, fam, which is my favorite gender-neutral way to address a crowd, if I ask you a question, feel free to answer from your heart, not necessarily your mind, right
25. So, if you were going to say, like, what is feminism, what would you say
26. Equality between the sexes
27. Okay, equality between the sexes
28. Give it up
29. Yeah
30. All right, all right
31. And if you were gonna just, like, spitball a year, spitball a year that feminism started, what would you say
32. Ooh, 1970
33. 1970s, okay, give it up
34. Um, close
35. It was actually, uh
36. It's actually 2013
37. It was started by the musical recording artist Beyonce
38. She has this album that really breaks everything down
39. I couldn't get the rights to play it even though my dad is a fucking lawyer
40. I just got this quote that sort of just breaks everything down
41. Visionary feminism is a wise and loving politics
42. It is rooted in the love of male and female being, refusing to privilege one over the other
43. Who do you think said that
44. Beyonce
45. Okay, close
46. It was actually
47. Solange
48. The creator of black feminism
49. That's just a feminist enjoying nature
50. all right, you guys are probably like, okay, Chad, like how could you just drag us like this and like not give us anything to do
51. And it's like, well, I'll give you guys something very actionable that we could all start doing right now
52. We gotta stop cat calling you guys
53. We gotta stop it
54. I personally, I never really like cat called in real life
55. I was more of like a digital cat caller
56. I would just like open Tinder messages and be like, what's up queen
57. My face is a throne, you know, like just sort of
58. stuff like that, but I don't do that anymore, because I'm wiser
59. Now, I just drop facts about female scientists
60. Rosalind Franklin is remembered for her breakthrough discoveries in the structure of DNA that she never celebrated due to an untimely death, baby girl
61. Works every time
62. Put your own spin on it, you know
63. Follow me on Twitter at wokewoke94, everybody
64. Okay, what's up, you guys
65. What's up, New Orleans
66. Yeah, oh my God
67. What's up
68. I'm so happy to be in New Orleans
69. It's way colder than I was expecting it to be here
70. It's, like, a dangerous level of cold outside right now, where, like, a cold wind blows, you just, like, wake up in an Ikea, like, three years deep into a monogamous relationship, you know
71. You drink a latte too fast, you're just, like, at your own flash mob proposal, just like, what happened
72. I was living in L
73. A
74. for a year
75. That shit was whack, honestly
76. It was wack
77. I, like, tried doing, like, all the California stuff, too, like, when I was out there
78. I tried going vegan for a while
79. Very up-and-down process, mostly just because whenever I would stand up, I would just, like
80. pass out
81. Wake up, someone's doing my birth chart for me
82. I also tried yoga while I was in LA, because I was like, yoga's easy, right
83. That's just like laying on the ground for 45 minutes
84. I could do that
85. And then like halfway through the first class, I was just like shaking
86. The instructor came up to me like, you can give up or you can try
87. I was like, oh my God
88. I feel so attacked by this dude in a spiritual gangster crop top
89. Trying to gentrify my muscles right now
90. I also love how yoga has basically just become like a slow electric slide for white people at this point
91. Like, to the left
92. Take it back now, y'all
93. Now maintaining that breath one hop this time
94. Also, white people, y'all went the fuck off when you made buffalo cauliflower
95. That's so good
96. Keep that energy up
97. Stop calling the cops
98. Get in the kitchen
99. Honestly
100. But I was like, you know what
101. Any exercise I do is going to be difficult
102. That's kind of the point of exercise
103. I might as well go all the way
104. I'm going to take an MMA class
105. I'm going to learn how to fight
106. I did learn one cool thing from this class
107. I learned that if someone is attacking you standing up like this, right, what you got to do is you got to stick your arm up, twist your body, drop your elbow
108. You can get out of the hold safe, right
109. But the instructor prefaced that saying, like, sometimes you're in the middle of a fight
110. You don't have time to do all that choreo or whatever
111. You got to do whatever it takes to get out of that hold
112. And I was like, okay, Beck, got you
113. My sparring partner put his hand around my throat, and I went, Daddy
114. And he let go, you know
115. Sometimes love wins
116. That's all it takes
