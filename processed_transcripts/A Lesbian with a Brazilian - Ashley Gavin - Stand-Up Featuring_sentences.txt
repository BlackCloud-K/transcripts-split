1. Hi
2. Hi, hi, hi, hi
3. All right, I'm gay
4. You can stop thinking about it
5. You can laugh at me being gay
6. It's okay
7. I see you straight people
8. I like being gay
9. Yeah, you're gay or
10. Oh, you did not like that at all
11. You're gay now
12. You laughed at my jokes
13. You gay little bitch
14. All right
15. All right, let's get started
16. I like being gay
17. My favorite part is the homophobia has gotten pretty good
18. Yeah, it's gotten pretty good
19. You guys hear about this pastor in the South who said he'd unlock the problem to getting rid of all the gays
20. Yeah, it's on YouTube
21. Fantastic
22. You have to watch it
23. He's like, well, the first thing we gotta do, we gotta take all the lesbians, put them in a big, electrified fence, I'm in
24. Stop right there
25. I'm in
26. Put me in the cage with the other lesbians
27. I don't need to know the rest
28. Let's just fucking do it
29. Sometimes I feel a little bit more like a guy socially than a
30. Because I'm not like a regular woman
31. You guys picked up on that, right
32. I see some regular women
33. You guys have complex social rules that I don't fully understand
34. Maybe the men know it better than the women, because it's so bizarre
35. Women will break up with their friends
36. You've heard this, right
37. Like, Heather, too toxic
38. I had to end that
39. And I'm like, end what
40. Brunch
41. What are you talking about
42. You've never heard a man be like, with Dave, I just give and I give and I give and I give
43. so much advice about crypto, and he never reciprocates, right
44. Ask a man about his best friend
45. He is loyal
46. He's like, Dan, I thought beside that man, I would die for him
47. You're like, you guys meeting the service
48. Nah, Knicks game, three weeks ago
49. I have a couple lesbian surprises
50. I'm sporting a Brazilian right now
51. This guy lost his shit over that
52. I know, and then I got a couple woos from some creeps
53. I like that
54. That's good
55. I know, right
56. It is surprising, a lesbian with a Brazilian
57. Kelly, can you be a lesbian with a Brazilian
58. Like, I was scared to get my wax, not because of the pain, but I was like, is this gonna fundamentally change who I am
59. Like, they'll rip out that last strip, and I'll wake up with a dick in my mouth, and my nail's done
60. Like, what is gonna happen
61. Are we pulling back on dick in my mouth
62. If you're gonna pull back on dick in my mouth and my nail's done, you're gonna hate the rest of my fucking set, okay, you pieces of shit
63. I woke up this morning, I said, don't do crowd work, Ashley, and
64. I can't help it
65. I'm sort of a genius at it
66. All right
67. I love my Brazilian, though
68. I love it
69. I think it looks better
70. It feels better
71. I got catcalled leaving the salon
72. I walked out of the wax center, and this dude was like, damn, girl
73. You got that fresh wax pussy glow
74. And I look like this all the time
75. I'm a lesbian
76. I'm a feminist
77. I never get catcalled, but I've been training for this moment my entire fucking life
78. One goddamn wax
79. I'm like, oh, my God, thank you
80. He's my boyfriend now, so
81. That's not the best catcall I've ever gotten
82. The best catcall I've ever gotten, true story, I was walking down the street, and this guy went, hey
83. I got a nice dick for your asshole
84. That was it
85. And I burst out laughing
86. Because as a feminist, I'm mad
87. But as a consumer, I'm impressed
88. I don't have any questions about the product, right
89. I also appreciate the brevity of the catcall
90. Very short, concise
91. No fat on the catcall
92. He sees I'm walking, he's got a small window to sell me on his cock
93. The guy's like an old-time newsie, right
94. He's out on the corner like, Wall Street crashes
95. Thanks for your asshole
96. Yeah, but I was with a woman at the time
97. And it was sort of new
98. And I think the men in here kind of know that when it's new and you're with a woman, you get a little bit
99. And lesbians especially get a little
100. Because I don't know if there are any lesbians in here, but I consider myself slightly
101. Great, cool, one
102. I consider myself
103. You
104. You're thinking
105. You're just gonna decide right now
106. no go ahead let's share with comedy central in the entire world whether or not you're gay but i consider myself a little bit masculine you seem a little bit feminine when i date feminine women it's interesting because i disappear in the eyes of men when i'm walking around with them when you're a lesbian and you put on a backwards baseball cap It's like the Harry Potter invisibility cloak
107. They don't see us anymore
108. They just see these hot feminine women, and they hit on our girls, so we have a chip on our shoulder
109. And when men hit on a lesbian's girl, we do what I call the little butch shuffle
110. So I butch shuffle on over to this guy
111. No plan
112. Also not an easy person to confront, a cat caller
113. The dick for your asshole, man
114. No plan
115. I just go up to him, I go, hey, dude, I'm gay
116. And then he went, shit, fuck, I had no idea
117. God damn it
118. I'm sorry
119. And then he shook my hand
120. said, love wins, man, and walked away
121. It blew my mind
122. My whole life, I'm like, catcalls are crazy
123. They can't be reasoned with
124. No, they're social liberals
125. They live amongst us
126. They're here
127. This guy is a catcaller and a gay rights supporter
128. He's like, I fought for your two's right to get married, and if you do, I'll tap both your asses
129. That's what I'll do
130. Have a great day
131. All right, I'm gonna try and fit one in now
132. I'm single, and I think it's because I'm 35, and I dress like a middle school fuckboy, so
133. No one should dress like this
134. Nobody
135. My name's Ashley Gavin
136. I think I dress like my name's just Gavin
137. The look I'm trying to go for is, like, confident, androgynous, handsome woman, but I think I'm more in the realm of, like, troubled, pubescent, beautiful boy
138. If you can't see it from the front, let me just skate away
139. Not a gender thing
140. I identify as a woman
141. It's just that other people identify me as Kyle from Spanish class
142. And this was a great look for when I was slutting around, but I'm not doing that anymore
143. I swiped, I came, I conquered, you know
144. Veni, vici, vagi, if you know the lack
145. I named my strap on Brutus, but that's not the point
146. Oh, a couple of you read
147. That's cool
148. Good, good, good
149. The rest of you can Google that shit when you get home
150. Or write it in the comments or whatever
151. I don't know where this is going
152. But now I crave intimacy
153. I don't want to be a slut anymore
154. You know what I mean
155. I want intimacy
156. But my problem is, I don't know how to get to intimacy without fucking my way to it
157. You understand
158. You know what I mean
159. Like, I don't want to be a whore, but I don't know how else to get a hug
160. Does that make sense
161. Which app is that
162. Where you match, you don't hook up, you just kind of scratch each other's heads
163. I don't want Tinder
164. I want Tickler
165. You know
166. That's what I'm looking for
167. And this outfit, it gives the wrong impression, because women think that I'm, like, a fuckboy, but really what I want to do is just cuddle
168. And I never know how to ask for a cuddle while being in this character
169. You know what I'm saying
170. Like, oh, girl, come back to my hotel room, and we will cry
171. You know, like that
172. Like, you will be wet with tears, girl
173. So what I do instead, well, I could just ask for a cuddle
174. That is right
175. You're laughing
176. I could just literally ask if I can be held
177. But I can't do that because I don't have a good relationship with my mom
178. So
179. Instead, what I do is I have my cuddle plan
180. The cuddle plan is I'm gonna fuck her good, I'm gonna fuck her good, I'm gonna fuck her good
181. And then I am baby
182. You understand
183. I'm gonna fuck the shit out of her and then num-num-num, nurse from mommy, yes
184. Get the self-esteem, the nutrients
185. Some of you pulling back on the mommy issues
186. Yes
187. I want to be so deep inside of this woman we're connected by an umbilical cord, okay
188. When I pull my fingers out, I want her to name them
189. Kyle, Ashley, the twins
190. But sometimes it's hard to earn that validation in bed
191. You know what I mean
192. I don't know if you guys have had a night like this
193. Like one time I was touching, I was, I was, this is her clit
194. I was touching her
195. Wow, not enough laughter on that
196. some learning going on i'm touching i don't know why the clit is all the way over here it should be here closer to you probably unless you want to put the on a pedestal that's fine if that's your move but i'm touching her i'm touching someone clapping for that shut up no off okay I'm touching her clit, I'm having one of those nights where she's like, she's like, harder, harder, harder, harder
197. And I'm like, okay
198. So I'm going harder
199. And she's like, harder, harder, harder, harder
200. and my arm is flaring up
201. And every vulva, beautiful, perfect in every way
202. This one, made of steel, possibly
203. She's like, harder, harder, harder
204. I'm like, this isn't a bean, it's a brick
205. I look like lesbian Karate Kid
206. just going for my pink belt
207. You know what I'm saying
208. She's like, harder, harder, harder
209. What do you want me to do
210. Punch it
211. What is happening
212. You want a full Rocky
213. Just
214. I look like a mountain goat on Discovery Channel just digging my hoof
215. Clinging to a cliff
216. You know
217. Like, what are we doing
218. Making pussy-side guacamole
219. What is this
220. You guys were okay
221. I'm Ashley Gavin
