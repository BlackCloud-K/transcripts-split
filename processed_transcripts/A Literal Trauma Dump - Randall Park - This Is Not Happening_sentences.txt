1. Mr
2. Randall Park, everybody
3. So I have a very sensitive stomach
4. I'd say about half my shits are diarrheas
5. And it's not just when I eat something bad
6. It's also when I experience anxiety or trauma
7. And I'd say the most traumatic period of my life was in middle school
8. I went to this school called Palms Middle School
9. And I was this chubby, shy, awkward little Asian kid
10. I got bullied
11. I got beat up occasionally
12. It was a nightmare
13. But eventually, I graduated, and I ended up going to high school, and I just felt a lot better
14. I grew up, I felt more confident, I made friends
15. And one day, in high school, one of my friends came up to me and was like, hey, do you wanna catch a talent show that my little sister's in
16. It's at Palms
17. And I could feel my body, like, tensing up
18. But then I felt better, and I was like, oh, you know what
19. That's past me
20. I'm confident now, you know what, yeah, yeah, I'll be there
21. So that Saturday comes, riding my bike to my old middle school, I lock up my bike, and the moment I set foot on the campus, I could feel my stomach start to turn
22. But I pay it no mind, I see my friends sitting in the front row, and they save me a seat
23. I join them, and the talent show begins
24. And as soon as I sit down, I feel like I need to use the restroom
25. But I just got there, so I decide to fight it through
26. About a half hour into the show, I am literally like in the fetal position
27. I'm like shaking, and then I think, you know what, I gotta relieve this pressure
28. I'm gonna try to release some gas
29. And this hot squirt shoots out of my butt and I'm like, oh no
30. And I go up to my friends and I'm like, look, guys, I'll be back
31. And I like quick step out of the auditorium and I kick open the door and I'm in the restroom
32. Now the restroom at Palms, there are two stalls
33. One of them has the door completely ripped off
34. The other one, I go in there, the toilet is filled with paper towels and someone else's shit
35. And I try to flush it, it just won't go down
36. And at this point, I'm like, I'm about to explode
37. So I have no choice, I close the door, I pull down my pants, and I'm like hovering over the toilet, and I just let it loose
38. And it's like, it's not like a shit, it's like a damn burst
39. Right, and it's weird because it's like this spiritual situation going on
40. My eyes were closed and I felt like these demons were like shooting out of my body
41. Like all of those experiences from middle school, the kids beating me up and all the kids pointing at me and laughing at me
42. It was just shooting out of me
43. It was the most cathartic shit I had ever taken in my life
44. Right
45. And it keeps going, and then it just stops
46. And I open my eyes
47. I feel like a new man
48. I feel, like, completely reborn, right
49. And then I look down at my shoes, and I see this brown pool start forming around my feet
50. And then I look down into my pants
51. It is filled to the brim with shit
52. I look back at the toilet, covered
53. The wall splatters everywhere
54. I'm like, oh, my God
55. Oh, no
56. And I see this renegade, like, stream start moving out from under the stall, and just on instinct, I start squeegeeing it back in with the side of my shoe
57. And I'm like, oh, no
58. Oh, no, what do I do
59. I start pulling out the toilet paper, and I start, like, like a sinking rowboat
60. I start, like, just, like, scooping it out of my pants
61. And I'm like, oh, no, I need more
62. I need paper towels
63. I need paper towels
64. So I pull up my pants, and they're heavy and cold
65. And I, like, Charlie Chaplin it over to the paper towels, and I start yanking out paper towels
66. And then I hear the audience applause
67. And I'm like, oh, no
68. It's intermission
69. And I look out into the bathroom
70. There's, like, shit footprints all over the floor
71. Streaks of shit going underneath into the stall
72. It's a crime scene
73. And I hear the audience walking into the lobby and I run into the stall and I just close it and I just stand there
74. Just waiting for this onslaught of people
75. And I hear the door open
76. I hear a father and son walk in a few steps and I hear the son say, daddy, what happened in here
77. And the father, I hear him go, let's go, come on, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go
78. And then the door closes
79. And I hear the door open again, a teenage boy literally screaming, and the door closes
80. This happens over and over and over and over again, and I just want to die
81. Eventually, it got to the point where the door stopped opening, and I was like, oh, okay, they must be back in the show
82. The second half must have begun
83. Now's my time to get the hell out of here
84. So I run out through the lobby, out of the auditorium, and I see my bike, and I beeline to my bike, and from the corner of my eye, I see a group of kids
85. pointing at me and laughing at me
86. And I realize I cannot run from the trauma of my middle school years
87. It is always gonna be with me
88. I unlock the bike, I jump on it, and I pedal home as fast as I could, and I never went back to that middle school again
