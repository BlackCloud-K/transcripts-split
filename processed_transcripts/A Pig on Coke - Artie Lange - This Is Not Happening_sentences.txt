1. Mr
2. Artie Lang, everybody
3. Here's the story
4. I come out here in 1995 to do a show called Mad TV
5. It was a sketch comedy show
6. Oh, well, thank you
7. All right
8. So one of the sketches we did was called Babe Watch
9. And that was Babe the Pig in Baywatch
10. My hand to God
11. So guess who played Babe the Pig
12. Come on
13. We had a big budget, so we shot it on location in Malibu
14. It was a two-day shoot
15. I go out there
16. I had to be there at 4 a
17. m
18. to get three hours of pig prosthetics, a pig face, a pig snout, six teats, the bikini top on each one
19. That was the joke
20. And I said, I'm not going to get through this without cocaine
21. Not going to happen
22. So my Coke dealer in New York hooked me up with this guy, a contact he had in L
23. A
24. , who was a Coke dealer
25. And this guy, he was the best cocaine dealer ever
26. He was always right on time
27. You called him, he was like, I'm there, you know
28. So I call him
29. I call him from the set
30. And I go, dude, you got to fucking, you got to meet me on the Pacific Coast Highway
31. I got to get something from you
32. I got to get an eight ball from you
33. And he goes, all right, all right
34. Can you get to this restaurant, Duke's
35. Can you get to the restaurant
36. And I'm like, yeah, yeah, I think I can
37. So I hang up with him
38. I look around
39. Now I'm in every shot of this sketch
40. I look at the assistant directors
41. I'm not looking for two seconds
42. I run to my car
43. I get in my car, and I speed the fuck away
44. I just speed away
45. I'm doing, like, at 90 miles an hour
46. Looking, I'm telling you, exactly like a pig
47. I get the Dukes, I pull in
48. He's already there
49. The fucking guy, he goes, what, you had a brunch at Dukes
50. What happened
51. Now, I never told him I was on a TV show because I was afraid to, like, share my life with him
52. And I forget myself
53. He sees me get out of this car
54. And he looks at me
55. I'll never forget the look on his face
56. He looks at me and goes
57. Damn, man, what kind of crazy shit are you into
58. He probably thought I was at some crazy drug party, you know
59. I get back in my car and I put some Coke on the end of a key
60. I go to do it
61. I can't get the Coke through the pigs now
62. I can't do it
63. So now I'm thinking, I'm the only one in the history of the world who's ever had this problem
64. So now three hours of prosthetics I went through, okay
65. So I'm like, fuck it
66. I make a decision
67. I break the fucking nose, which means when I get back there, it's going to be an hour of fixing it before we shoot
68. I'm in every shot
69. So I break the fucking big nose
70. I do a couple of blasts
71. I'm like, okay, I'm fine
72. Now I get back on the Pacific Coast Highway
73. I rush back towards Oxnard
74. I stop at a light at Topanga Canyon, and I figure I'm gonna do another hit
75. I got it up to my nose like this
76. I look over, and there's this beautiful woman in a Lamborghini
77. This is the look on her face
78. And I realize she's looking at a pig driving a car doing cocaine
79. Then I'm thinking, you know, fuck her
80. It's LA
81. It's probably the third time she saw that that day
82. So I do another hit
83. I drive
84. I get to the fucking set
85. Everybody wants to kill me
86. But they can't really say it yet because we got to do 14 hours of shooting
87. So they see that my fucking nose is fucked up
88. They have to redo my nose
89. Look, I was a fuck-up
90. Every two hours, I broke the nose again to do coke
91. And every two hours, she had to fix it
92. And she knew what was going on
93. I wasn't fooling anybody
94. So this happens
95. We get through the day, and it's a nightmare
96. So we had a shoot the next day
97. They got us a little motel right on the ocean there, which was next to the shoot
98. So I go in
99. I fall asleep in the bed
100. I wake up the next morning
101. At some point during the night, every bad thing in my body must have just fell out of me
102. I shit the bed
103. and I had a lot of bad in me
104. I wake up, you know, the scene in the Godfather, the horse's head, where he wakes up, he sees all the blood
105. I was like, I had shit all over the bed
106. I was late
107. I had no time to clean it up
108. I just, I took a steaming hot shower, got dressed, ran out
109. I had no time to clean up
110. So I just threw the bedspread over all the shit
111. I mean, it was a river of shit
112. I had no cash for a tip
113. And I got there
114. I got through the day
115. Everything was fine
116. So we're driving home, and I'm thinking about the hotel, and I'm worried about it
117. I'm like, oh, well, you know, I'm just gonna have to be embarrassed by that
118. But then I realized the room wasn't in my name
119. The room was in the name of the first assistant director
120. This guy, Josh
121. If they want to blame somebody, they're gonna say, this guy, Josh, you know, shit the bed and didn't clean up
122. My name's Artie Lang
123. That's my story
