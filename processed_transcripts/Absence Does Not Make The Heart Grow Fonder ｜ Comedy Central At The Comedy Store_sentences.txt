1. I'm Lauren and I know it's a massive cliche to be like, it's nice to be here, but it is
2. It's nice to be here because this is my one year anniversary of moving to London
3. Thank you
4. I moved here to do comedy full time
5. I lived in Newcastle and I was like, right, I want to be a comedian
6. That's all I want to do
7. That's all I want to be
8. I'm going to go to London
9. I'm going to go full time
10. That's what I'm going to do
11. I'm young, ambitious
12. I'm going to go full time
13. So I came here a year ago and I don't want to brag because I want you to like it, but within six weeks I'd gone full time
14. Thank you
15. In boots, but still
16. I had a long-term boyfriend when I moved to London
17. I left him up north and he went, don't worry about me
18. Don't worry about me
19. Absence makes the heart grow fonder
20. That's a lie, isn't it
21. Absence didn't make his heart grow fonder
22. Absence just made his dick wander
23. That's all that happened then
24. All that happened, I thought, I'm young
25. I'm having the time of my life
26. I'm in a new city
27. This is an exciting time for me
28. I'm not going to be sad
29. I am not going to get straight on the dating apps because I'm quite shy, quite awkward
30. I'm going to get myself out there, meet some new people
31. I have never felt so empowered using dating apps because I didn't used to get a lot of attention when I was younger
32. And for the first time, 23-year-old adult, I can sit there I can decide I'm too good for someone
33. I can decide that I'm too attractive for someone
34. I can decide that someone's not worth 60 seconds of my time
35. And I can make all these decisions while I'm having a shit
36. I have never, never felt more like a goddess
37. It really happens
