1. Yeah, you could get away with whatever you want if you have a cute accent, but I think the opposite is true if you have a thick, regional, American accent
2. Then you can't get away with anything because everyone thinks you're dumb as shit
3. And it's super unfair, you know
4. Like, I grew up in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, which has a very trashy accent
5. And it's so unfair because there are people in Pittsburgh with that accent who are very, very smart
6. But are they
7. I don't know
8. It's kind of hard to buy sometimes, you know
9. Yeah, it's very hard to buy sometimes
10. Even the people in Pittsburgh who are in positions where you know just to get there, they have to be smart
11. Like imagine being in a courtroom in Pittsburgh and the judge walks in looking very distinguished, wearing the robe, and then he sits down and opens his mouth and says, okay, so nobody freak out or nothing, but jurors deliberated and concluded
12. Defend us guilty beyond reasonable doubt
13. You'd be like, uh, are you sure
14. Can we put you in jail
15. Is that an option to put the judge in jail
16. The reason I say is because the way you talk makes it sound like you've maybe stabbed someone over a sausage argument
17. This guy's trying to freaking tell me kill bosses, not top five sausage
18. What am I supposed to do, not shank them
19. Get out of here
20. That's how people talk in Pittsburgh
21. And sausage is like a top priority for most of the people I grew up with in Pittsburgh
22. It's messed up
23. Thank you
24. I use the British accent a lot
25. I think it's my favorite voice to do
26. Really love the British accent
27. I love that you can tell just how British someone is by how many syllables they use
28. Like regular British, now
29. Really British, now
30. Super British, now
31. And then the most British is that plus a million super short fake sounding words at the end
32. I used to have a boss who was British
33. Why do you think I got fired
34. Could it have been something I had done
35. We'll never know
36. No, we do know
37. We know why I got fired at that job
38. It was because I was bad at it
39. Yeah, that was it
40. I was very bad at this office job
41. The only thing I was good at, honestly, was farting quietly
42. That I was
43. incredible at
44. It's a skill that you develop like any other
45. But even as good as I was at farting quietly, I would occasionally let out an audible fart
46. You know, I'm human
47. And I found every time I would, I'd immediately start banging things around on my desk, like slapping the table, opening and closing drawers
48. Because in my head, I thought I was going to replicate the sound of the fart
49. with something else
50. And usually it would be like rubbing my vinyl chair
51. Usually that would sound a lot like a fart
52. So you'd be like, oh, this is great
53. Do this a whole bunch, get a whole bunch of reps in
54. So if anyone had initially heard me, they'll now think, oh, Joe didn't fart
55. He was just rubbing his chair
56. Of course
57. But what they were probably really thinking was, hey, Joe farted
58. He definitely farted
59. And then fell down on a bunch of shit
60. And then farted like 10 more times
61. What a maniac
62. We should fire him
63. And they did
64. They did fire me
65. I was without a job for a long time
66. I didn't care, you know
67. I liked going on job interviews
68. I thought that was very funny because they would always ask me the same question
69. They would always ask me, Joe, do you think outside the box
70. Do you know that box, Joe
71. Do you think outside it
72. And that was so funny to me because every job I was applying for was like an entry-level position
73. So all I would be doing at the job would be like answering the phones
74. And I don't think you want me answering the phones for your company outside the box
75. I don't think that would be very good for you if I was at the front desk and I was like, thank you for calling the offices of Jackson and Miller
76. Goodbye
77. That's why you don't hire a bad boy
