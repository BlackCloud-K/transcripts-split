1. Here's the first place my mum saw me do stand-up
2. It was about four years ago
3. And to give you an idea of how little she understood the evening, she bought four tickets to the show
4. One for herself, one for my dad, one for my sister, and one for me
5. She did not understand it, but she finds it weird that I do this job
6. She doesn't like it
7. She thinks I should be a rich person by now and have lads
8. But, like, my parents' generation, they're just on another planet
9. Like, my mum's got a drawer just for wrapping paper
10. Various types of wrapping paper
11. I keep my jeans in the same drawer that I keep my mustard
12. I think they want me to have a proper job and stuff, but I just can't do it
13. I can't do job interviews
14. Because my small talk is so shit
15. I know small talk is meant to be questions like, how are you
16. What have you been doing
17. I don't know what it's meant to be, but I always mess it up slightly and say something like, where is your father
18. Or like, what will you buy in February
19. And
20. It's stupid
21. I should be better at it now
22. I'm a grown-up
23. But, like, by the way, I only realised I was a grown-up recently when I realised you can have profiteroles whenever you want
24. You know you can just buy profiteroles
25. But since I'm at an event, I see profiteroles, I'm always like
26. How many profiteroles are we allowed
27. I don't know, as many as you want
28. So, four
29. And I don't realise, I think, the reason I get embarrassed and nervous in job interviews, I assume the person thinks I'm stupid, all my friends think I'm stupid
30. And I know that from the frequency with which my friends show me how to use their shower
31. Most insulting thing you can show someone
32. So this one turns it on
33. Okay
34. And you see this blue and red one
35. Go on
