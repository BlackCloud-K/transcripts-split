1. What would I tell her
2. If I was to tell my younger self something now, I would tell her
3. Me
4. The stuff that you're currently getting in trouble for, you'll get paid for it later
5. Just hone it in quicker
6. What would I tell young people right now
7. I would tell them so much
8. My younger self would like to know that when you have a brush, the pills that they give you are actually to put inside your vagina and not to swallow
9. And when you swallow them, it does give you a cold body rash
10. So stop doing that and stop reading the instructions
11. Stop straightening your hair
12. It gets better, it gets better
13. I would tell young Katie, I would tell young Evelyn, do not text him
14. Don't sleep with that guy
15. Blog him that you slept with
16. Don't talk to him ever again
17. You know who
18. If it's about to happen, just don't do it
19. Don't do it
20. Just walk away
21. I would tell, like, probably six months ago, Kate, to be fair
22. And be more confident
23. I don't know how to do that yet, but do that, Kate
24. Do that
25. Just be yourself and don't worry what anyone else is telling you
26. Just embrace who you are as a person because you are amazing
27. Oh
28. I would say leave Cornwall and know it's all going to be okay
29. The best advice that me now could give to little, little Helen wandering around flea would be
30. That you're trans, so save 15 years of your life trying to figure it out and just realise that it is indeed true
31. That would probably be the most helpful thing
32. Why would you leave Cornwall
33. Never step in a puddle if you can't remember the last time it rained because you will get a lot of piss on you
34. If you want to do something, literally just do it
35. Don't wait
36. Don't put it on
37. And then before you know it, it's going to be 10 years
38. So if you've got a passion about something, pursue it
39. And if you pursue it and you work hard, you'll get where I am today
40. Oh my god, I would tell young people not to get a perm because it's the late noughties and no one else has a perm and you look ridiculous
41. You look ridiculous
42. That's what I would say
43. Comfy clothing is never the wrong option and always just go comfy
44. When you think you need to wear high heels and tight stuff, you don't, just always go comfy
45. Flat shoes, pyjamas, no one will judge you
46. Things happen for a reason
47. Everything kind of just falls into place
48. You don't have to panic
49. You don't have to worry
50. You don't have to look at other people, worry about other people's destinations, because your destination is coming
51. Yeah
52. Yeah, it's going to be very close steps
53. God's planning everything
54. It's all right
55. It's okay
56. It's all right
57. I think I would say that you're not going to expect all the great things that are going to happen to you
58. It's really nice when you grow up
59. It's real nice
60. And to keep writing
61. Keep actually writing
62. Actually write stuff down when they happen to you
63. Write them down because they're funny and they'll be useful later
64. And don't be stupid
65. And I love you
