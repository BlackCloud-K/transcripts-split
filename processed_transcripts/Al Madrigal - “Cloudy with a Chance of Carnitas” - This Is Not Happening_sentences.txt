1. Al Madrigal
2. In 2002, I get this gig in East San Jose, California
3. And you don't have to be familiar with the San Francisco Bay Area to know that anything east, most cities, usually pretty shitty
4. So
5. I go to the gig, and it's 2,000 Mexicans in a GI hall, just packed
6. It's like a big cafeteria
7. And my wife looks at me, and she goes, dude, you got to get the fuck out of here
8. because she's supportive like that
9. And I say, no, honey, have a little faith in me
10. I can handle myself
11. Now, the reason my wife is concerned is that the guy before me is doing his entire act in Spanish and destroying
12. Every single time he hits a big punchline, little Mexican guys with gold-plated teeth, they all have corn on the stick, so they're fucking putting their corns in the air
13. Crema is flying everywhere
14. It's, like, cloudy with a chance of carnitas
15. And I didn't know that the Mexican corn was like the concert lighter for a Latino Def Jam show
16. So now I gotta go up there
17. And I asked myself, I go, okay, I can do this
18. What would Carlos Mencia do in this situation
19. That's one of the rare times you wanna ask yourself that question
20. There I go
21. I know
22. I'm gonna go up there, and I do a little cheerleading
23. So I go up on stage, and I go, what's up, East San Jose
24. Make some noise
25. And they all made some noise, all right
26. So I'm doing good
27. So I say, where are all the white people at
28. White people, make some noise, white people
29. Nothing
30. Half of me is the only white guy there
31. So I say, where are the black people at
32. Black people, make some noise
33. Black people
34. Nothing
35. Where the hell were you guys
36. Could have fucking used you
37. And then I say, so it's all Latinos
38. 2,000 corns just up in the air at the exact same time
39. And I'll never forget, right where you are in the front, this little guy goes, isai, Latinos
40. And I said, east side, Latinos
41. Even bigger roar
42. Like, think of bacon-wrapped hot dog when flying
43. Then I proceeded to do my act just by saying fuckers and bros nonstop
44. Just fuckers and bro, fuckers and bros
45. And then humping for no reason whatsoever
46. Didn't make any fucking sense
47. If you're sitting near a Latino, look how much they love this right now
48. They can't get enough
49. What's up, fuckers
50. I just had a new baby, fuckers, fuckers
51. Bro, bro, fuckers, fuckers
52. Then I go to the next gig
53. It's a two-parter
54. Next day, it's in Stockton, California
55. This meth shithole in the middle of nowhere
56. Industry has died
57. It was like ground zero for the housing crisis, right
58. Foreclosure signs everywhere
59. People are angry all the time
60. I think there's just pods with embryonic MMA fighters
61. So I walk into the show, and I walk backstage
62. Now, the guy who's doing so well the night before, you remember him
63. He's now crying
64. He's got a tear running down his cheek
65. And I go, Ruben, what's wrong
66. How was your set
67. He goes, Al, they threatened my life
68. Now I gotta go up there, and I already determined I'm not gonna be this Latino Def Jam character that I'm not
69. My parents sent me to French school in San Francisco
70. I went to Ecole Notre Dame de Victoire
71. I used to wear a sailor suit to school every single day
72. I rode the cable car with a dickie blowing in the wind
73. Now I'm gonna be this Latino Def Jam character
74. That's bullshit
75. I'm gonna be myself
76. " And that was a horrible idea
77. Never be yourself
78. Change it up
79. Fuck it
80. What do you got to lose
81. So I go up on stage, and I start to do this bit about how my Spanish is horrible, and how you spot a half-Mexican overused to the word poquito
82. And this guy stands up right in the middle, right in the middle of the entire audience, and stands up and has this Braveheart moment
83. And he goes, he doesn't speak Spanish
84. And then starts violently flipping me off
85. Not just like, hey, fuck you, but holding it, shaking
86. So he starts leading people in boos against me
87. He's going, he doesn't speak Spanish
88. Woo
89. Woo
90. He doesn't speak Spanish
91. Woo
92. Woo
93. 20 people are booing
94. 80 people are booing
95. And finally, I broke down, which I tend to do
96. I said, look, you guys, this is exactly a dream gig for me either
97. I'm stuck in Stockton of all godforsaken places
98. And the best part about it is I get to leave, and you people are stuck here for the rest of your miserable fucking lives
99. now i'm taking the money and i'm being paid handsomely i'm gonna go blow it in tracy outlet malls so off and the guy stood back up and goes he's got money then i ended up jumping a fence like a salmon while the black security guards laughed at me that's how that turned out all right thank you very much everybody
