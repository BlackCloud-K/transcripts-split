1. My name's Al
2. I'll tell you guys about myself
3. I live in Los Angeles, and near my house in Los Angeles is a waterfall that I love to take the wife and the kids and get some dogs
4. We take them up there
5. But it's also near a sketchy neighborhood, so there's a lot of gang members that hang out at the waterfall
6. It's like somebody took an Ansel Adams photo and then put a Cypress Hill video inside it
7. And at first, I got to tell you, it's scary, because you don't expect to see gang members at the waterfall
8. And we actually witnessed this
9. This is a conversation that we overheard right when we got up there for the first time
10. We saw a gang member run up to another gang member with something in his hand
11. I'm like, oh, my God
12. My family is going to watch somebody get stabbed Creekside
13. The guy runs up and goes, hey, check it out
14. He's a tree frog, homes
15. Happened
16. Then the other guy says, how you know it's a tree frog, bro
17. I found it by a tree, stupid
18. And everyone in my family at the same moment went, best waterfall ever
19. This is nature loving Cholos
20. This is fantastic
21. And it is fantastic
22. I find myself watching the gang members appreciate nature more than I'm appreciating the nature
23. I like to imagine that they're all up there on an organized retreat to get away from gang life
24. Like a field trip that they signed up for to come together as a unit
25. They're up there doing trust exercises, like, I'm gonna fall back, you gotta catch me, bro
26. I always got you, I always got you
27. I also like to imagine that they're up there to take care of the forest
28. This Brown Beret Conservation Corps
29. A Smokey the Cholo, if you will
30. They graffitied the waterfall, which sucks
31. And it's not nice graffiti either, because there's good graffiti and then there's bad graffiti
32. Like it's not some tasteful mural that's been done to remember one of their fallen homeboys that died of Lyme disease
33. Airbrushed
34. R
35. I
36. P
37. Carlos, there's no dicks in heaven
38. She says, chucho
39. And you're giving me a funny look
40. They didn't graffiti the actual waterfall
41. It's like the dumbest gang members ever
42. It's not working
43. It's not working
44. No
45. So it just sort of proves that any time you take a gang member out of their element and you put them anywhere, it's automatically gonna be funny
46. Cholo's in space
47. Hilarious
48. Hey, Houston, you got a problem, bro
49. Sorry
50. Which leads me to my favorite character that I've met of all time
51. Cholo's soccer dad
52. They're everywhere
53. I didn't, I had no idea
54. So we're down in Los Angeles and we take my son to his first practice of Mighty Mites football
55. Five and six year olds playing flag football
56. It's adorable
57. And out of the corner of my eye, I'm there with the whole family, I see a cholo coming straight for us
58. Everybody, close your eyes and imagine your scariest Mexican gang member
59. That guy's walking right for us
60. Now, I'm using cholo a lot, and I'm not sure if anyone's traveling or from out of town
61. A cholo is a Latino gentleman that you may have seen with white socks pulled all the way up, plaid shorts to meet the white socks, white T-shirt oversized, very similar to a Catholic schoolgirl's uniform
62. It's a lot scarier
63. I'm not sure if you've seen the movie Training Day with Denzel Washington
64. That's cholo heavy
65. Have you ever watched The Prison Channel, aka Nat Geo
66. There's a lot of cholos to that
67. I think you're going to tune in and see some pygmy titty
68. Now, it's MS-13 shanking people by the handball court
69. Maybe some neck tattoos
70. Gold chain
71. I'm not sure if anybody wants to stand up and make this easier
72. Shaved head, mustache
73. Seen yourself with Cholo
74. You're not Cholo-y
75. You're, like, Cholo-adjacent
76. Uh, you're, like, uh
77. Sure, you're friends with some Cholos, but with a V-neck T-shirt like that, I'm not too worried
78. Uh, so
79. He's got a Caesar
80. I'm sure you know some, but I don't feel threatened
81. Anyway, Kai's coming right at us
82. Now, me and my wife have been together for about 12 years at this point
83. Married almost about that long
84. Oh, yeah, please, don't clap
85. Don't clap for her ass
86. Me and my wife are in sync
87. I know everything about this woman
88. I know her favorite everything
89. When we go to Target, we don't shop
90. We run plays
91. She knows exactly what I'm thinking, and she is right
92. I do think everyone in her family lacks ambition and will be a drain on us financially at some point
93. We have eye signals for stuff, hand signals for stuff
94. It's incredible
95. For example, if my wife has too much to drink at a party, I don't have to say anything
96. She starts yapping too much, I get to just go like this
97. Doot, doot, doot
98. Three little discreet leg squeezes under the table
99. She knows that means put a sock in it, drunkie
100. Time for you to wrap it up
101. Somebody didn't have dinner like I suggested, now you're spouting off at the mouth, divulging all the family secrets you need to pipe down to We Gotta Goo
102. And she's cool with it
103. That's the best part
104. She's like, was I talking too much
105. Thank you
106. And it works for me
107. So I rub the back of my wife's thumb
108. She knows that means cholo, 3 o'clock
109. Look alive
110. just coming right at us, like I said
111. A lot of neck tattoos
112. I'm trying to decipher them on the fly
113. I didn't watch Prison Break or Oz
114. They all mean something, right
115. And so I'm going, why is the rabbit crying
116. What does that mean
117. You did something to a rabbit
118. Me and my wife held each other for a little bit, thinking, okay, we had a good run, baby
119. Now we're gonna die
120. The guy comes up
121. Turns out he's our son's coach, no chef
122. He goes, hey, everybody, my name's Coach Frankie
123. But you can call me Rascal
124. See, honey, we're not going to die
125. Coach Rascal's here
126. It's going to be fine
127. He then presents us with a snack list
128. When your child is in any sport, the team mom, or in this case, a very scary Mexican gang member, has prepared a document to determine what family is responsible for snack on any given game day
129. He's laid his out perfectly in Microsoft Word tables
130. He left justified all of his texts
131. He didn't go with a Gotha Keecholo font like you'd expect him to
132. He used Arial like we all should
133. He centered his header, he imported some clip art
134. And he was very proud of it
135. So we found ourselves, he went, I brought a snack list
136. Check it out, my snack list
137. So me and my wife found ourselves in that great couple moment where you're holding hands, trying not to laugh at somebody right in front of you, doing the Morse code hand squeeze, going, troll me the snack list, troll me the snack list
138. Don't laugh at the troll, troll me the troll
139. Oh, my God
140. So proud of it
141. Now, if you're a young couple doing this for the first time, this snack thing, and you have kids in any sport, you want to go with the beginning of the season when expectations are low
142. You bring some Teddy Grahams, some Capri Suns, fruit, your brown baguette
143. Want to go the extra mile
144. Freeze a Go-Gurt
145. They fucking love that
146. What happens is you wait too long, then in the middle of the season, some asshole with disposable income brings Happy Meals, ruins it for the rest of the families yet to go
147. Then by the end of the season, you're forced to bring pizza, a DJ, and a stripper
148. And everybody's still complaining
149. They're like, are these songs fast to you
150. She seems older
151. So he's made a snack list
152. He's also the worst coach ever, but you can't do anything about it
153. He's so intimidating
154. He actually said this to the kids
155. They're five and six years old
156. When they get to football, they run in the wrong direction
157. They tackle each other
158. If there's a dog, they chase the dog
159. They're idiots
160. And he says, this is a quote, you guys gotta pay attention or you're gonna have bad dreams
161. which is not in the John Wooden coaching pyramid, I think
162. Leaving all the parents on the sideline going, did he just fall asleep
163. Because I have a hard enough time getting that guy to sleep as it is
164. I don't need Coach Rascal giving him cholo night terrors
165. Then my wife gives me one of these
166. You know this
167. You should know it
168. A hand squeeze with a squint and a head nod, which means, get in there, asshole, and say something
169. Time for you to man up, or I'm gonna say something
170. And there's a counter move to that
171. I squeezed her hand even a little bit harder, looked her in the eyes and said, we're not saying shit
172. You let Coach Rascal conduct his business, so we're gonna find out why the rabbit's crying, and I don't wanna find out
173. by the rabbits crying
174. I don't want to find out
