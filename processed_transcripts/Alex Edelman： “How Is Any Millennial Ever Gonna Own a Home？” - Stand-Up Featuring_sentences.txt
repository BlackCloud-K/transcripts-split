1. Has anyone seen the documentary Free Solo
2. Yes, a whole bunch of you guys
3. If you haven't seen Free Solo, it's about a guy named Alex Honnold
4. Alex Honnold climbed the northern face of El Capitan using nothing but his fingernails and his borderline autism
5. This guy was not intimidated by the northern face of El Capitan because this guy can't read expressions on any kind of face
6. The hero of the documentary is not Alex Honnold
7. The hero of the documentary is Alex Honnold's 23-year-old girlfriend who is four years away from realizing she's making a terrible mistake
8. Why is every documentary about, like, a vanilla psychopath
9. Can we have one documentary about just a normal dude, he works in IT, he lives in the suburbs, he goes to therapy, and at the end of the documentary, you find out he didn't need to
10. And instead, everything's about a maniac in search of the perfect piece of sushi
11. It's unbelievable
12. There's a scene in Free Summer where they're interviewing this guy and his girlfriend, and they're like, Alex, is there anything you're more dedicated to than climbing El Capitan
13. And he's like, no
14. Here's how sick I am as someone who just turned 30
15. The first thing I did after I saw the documentary was Google Alex Honnold, and I felt a palpable sense of relief when I realized he was three years older than me
16. as if in the next three years, I'm going to get my shit together and become the second man to free solo El Capitan
17. I thought, here's the thing
18. I think it's a really weird time to be a young person
19. And just like, I was writing on a TV show
20. And at the end of this TV show, I checked my bank balance on the ATM
21. And I had, not to brag, $5,421 in my bank account
22. And this is how little I know about being an adult
23. I saw the bank balance on the ATM screen
24. And I thought to myself, with no irony, I should buy a house
25. Not a big house
26. One of those small $5,000 houses
27. How is any millennial ever gonna own a home
28. How is any young person ever gonna own a home
29. It's made me hate old people
30. I see a few of you in here tonight
31. I hate you
32. Because every old person in a city like LA or New York or London is the same
33. They're like, my house is worth $2 million, but when I bought it in 1981, I paid 11 raspberries for it
34. And every young person's like, I have nine roommates
35. We each pay $11,000 a month
36. Although I missed the payment last month
37. He took a tow
38. I walk in a circle now
39. Every single one of us is a lawyer except for Ted
40. He's a dog with rabies, and we love to get him out, but his name is on the lease
41. And every single old person's like, I'm a librarian with a home at the beach
42. Go fuck yourself
43. How has this happened
44. And by the way, old people complain constantly like young people always complain
45. I have never heard a young person complain
46. I genuinely, I don't hear it happen
47. All I do, like my mom sometimes will be like, millennials, you guys live in your phones
48. I'm like, it's the only place we can afford to live
49. You're my landlord, you should know that
50. There are some, I was watching SpongeBob SquarePants with my cousin, younger cousin, he's two years younger than me, we enjoy the classics
51. And halfway through the show, I'm fuming because all I could think, I'm like, this sponge owns his own pineapple
52. And then he went upstairs, I'm like, this sponge owns a two-story pineapple
53. Oh, he must be a lawyer
54. He's not a lawyer
55. He works in a fast food restaurant
56. SpongeBob has family money, I am telling you
57. He changed his name to be more work in class, but his real name is Sponge Robert Rectangle Trousers
58. I swear to fucking God
59. Last month, the Dalai Lama gave an interview
60. And I'm not sure if any of you guys saw
61. You're nodding
62. I'm not sure if any of you guys saw this
63. It was amazing
64. It's a British woman, and she's got notes on a clipboard, and she's asking really softball questions to the Dalai Lama
65. She's like, Mr
66. Lama, what's your favorite kind of forgiveness, Mr
67. Lama
68. And, like
69. And then she asks a question that's supposed to be, like, a real feel-good question
70. She goes, Mr
71. Lama, do you ever think there's going to be a female Dalai Lama
72. And he went, yes
73. And I can see him be like
74. And then he continues, and he goes, but only if she's attractive
75. But she checks her notes, and she's really checking, but eventually she's like, nope, didn't have the Dalai Lama being sexist in here anywhere
76. And she was like, would you like to elaborate
77. And he's like, yes, well, today, people only listen to attractive people
78. So the next Dalai Lama will have to be attractive
79. And whether or not the Dalai Lama's right, I'm not gonna be the one to make that call
80. But whether or not the Dalai Lama's right, I have one thought that I have been thinking since I saw the interview
81. Does the Dalai Lama think he's hot
82. Does the Dalai Lama wake up every morning and look in the mirror and be like, Asian Charlie Brown, still got it, baby
83. Why does everyone in the dial on his Instagram photos have the caption, felt cute, might delete later on it
84. I am sick, by the way, of pretending that the stuff that I like is cool stuff
85. I don't like anything cool
86. I'm really excited for the day I can finally stop pretending to hate Coldplay
87. I love Coldplay
88. I love, and occasionally someone trying to be sympathetic will be like, oh yeah, the early stuff is good
89. And I'm like, no, all of it
90. And like, I was sitting in a car and Coldplay came on and the driver of the car went, oh, Coldplay
91. And I had to be like, yeah, I hate music
92. That makes it feel like he can do anything
93. And you know, I like uncool stuff
94. I went to see Josh Groban a couple of weeks ago
95. And screw you for the judgment on your face
96. I went to see Josh Groban
97. Not a girlfriend took me, not an aunt who likes it
98. I went to see Josh Groban
99. And I enjoyed it
100. He sang for two hours at Twilight outside Portland in an outdoor venue
101. It was magical
102. He sings in four different languages
103. He did Pure Imagination for Willy Wonka
104. I cried and I got into the car
105. I got into an Uber feeling fulfilled and the Uber driver ruined my bliss with three words
106. He said, who was playing tonight
107. And I said, Josh Groban
108. And he just went, ah, guilty pleasure
109. And I said, what
110. And I swear to God, he went, okay
111. And I said, why should I feel guilty
112. Huh
113. And he went, okay
114. And I said, why should I feel guilty for seeing a once in a generation talent sing timeless classics
115. And he didn't respond
116. And then I said something that I'm genuinely sure is the most embarrassing thing I've ever said
117. I crossed my arms
118. And after this, we were quiet for the rest of the ride
119. I crossed my arms and I just went, You can't help what gives you goosebumps
120. The worst tattoo I've ever seen is this
121. I worked with a girl at KFC, long story
122. And everyone called her Jennifer 9-11
123. Hold on, hold on, it's way worse than you think
124. she had a tattoo on her lower back of the Twin Towers and the words, never forget
125. First of all, boner killer
126. Second of all, that means that at some point in her life, she walked into a tattoo, presumably after 9-11, otherwise it's crazy
127. She walked into a tattoo parlor and was like, I want a permanent reminder of the saddest day in American history
128. And they were like, Gettysburg
129. And she's like, statistic, no
130. More recent
131. And they're like, 9-11
132. All right, where do you want it
133. And she's like, it should be a reminder
134. And they're like, yeah
135. She's like, you remind me every day
136. And they're like, yeah
137. Where do you want it
138. And she's like, well, what's the one part of my body I could never see ever unless I had a neck like an owl
139. But here's why it's really horrifying slash great
140. Because time isn't always kind to people's bodies
141. And eventually, her skin is gonna sag
142. And those Twin Towers are gonna collapse again
143. So it's less of a reminder and more of a reenactment
