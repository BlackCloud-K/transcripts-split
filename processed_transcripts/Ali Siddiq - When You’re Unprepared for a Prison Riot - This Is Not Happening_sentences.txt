62. Two bags of coffee
63. Come back a little later on in the day
64. I say, cool, Cece
65. So I wait three or four hours, and I knew he was working on my knife, because I was down the cell, and I heard on the ground

79. Look, first of all, you're going to have to do a rock and lean
80. Mexicans are going to come out there
81. They're going to have their knives
82. You're going to have to have your shirt off with your knife
83. And when you do this, you're going to have to rock to see what foot the Mexican going to kick you with
84. I said, this is too much
85. This is too much
86. It's like a choreographed dance
87. I don't know what the I'm doing
88. So I'm waiting to get my knife
89. I go back to CeCe
90. I say, yo, CeCe, I need my knife
91. He say, man, I just sold your knife
92. I say, man, what the , CeCe
93. You said it was a personal knife
94. For me, it cost two bags of coffee
95. Why it's not personal no more
96. He say, man, it was personal
97. Then a dude came in with three bags of coffee, then he made it business
98. I said, the ride about to jump off
99. Hey man, do what you can do
100. So I'm out there rocking with no knife
101. I've been practicing this shit for two hours, rocking
102. I'm not getting kicked, but I'm getting cut
