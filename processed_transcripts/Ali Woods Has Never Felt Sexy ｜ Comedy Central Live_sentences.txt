1. One time I slept with a Nigerian girl
2. We were 69 and we looked like the yin yang symbol
3. Yeah, both finished at the same time though
4. How's that for balance
5. Lovely to be here
6. I'm from London, which is fun because there's a lot of tourists
7. My favorite kind of tourists are the people who come to the UK for Harry Potter because we made them up
8. Do they not know
9. He never lived here
10. Are you guys finding this out for the first time
11. You see them down at King's Cross
12. Like, oh my God, is this where he went through platform nine and three quarters
13. And some English folks just like, uh, yeah, 20 quid to see that, 20 quid
14. Give me 40 quid, I'll show you where Hermione was born
15. It's just behind this JD Sports over here
16. 60 quid, you can smell Hagrid's fart, it's incredible
17. We've got Harry Potter tours
18. Is that just pointing out places where nothing happened
19. You can go on a Harry Potter tour right now
20. Close your eyes
21. There you go
22. Fly around Hogwarts
23. Enjoy yourselves
24. I'm going on dates again because I recently had a breakup
25. I'm over it
26. It's fine
27. She was a huge Harry Potter fan
28. And I hate going through a breakup because your friends give you really annoying advice
29. Like, the most common advice I get now is, well, it's better to have loved and lost
30. Which is true, but once you've loved, what's your alternative
31. To have loved and won
32. What even is that
33. Do you outlive them
34. At their funeral, going up to the casket, like, one deal
35. Yes
36. Take your top off to a lap of honour of the wake
37. Little Sambra on the grave
38. It was a great relationship
39. I'm very glad it happened
40. It was a great relationship
41. This is how great the relationship was
42. One of the biggest issues we had was that she was hornier than me
43. I know
44. I didn't even think that would ever be an issue
45. When I was a teenage boy in this department, I was confident
46. I was there on the playground with other boys
47. The thing about me is I need to have sex every day
48. I need to have sex every day
49. Because I'm a machine
50. I had sex three times during geography
51. I was a virgin, by the way
52. I need to have sex every day because I'm a machine
53. I need to have sex every day
54. But when you're faced with the reality, it's horrifying
55. I had no problem with the fact she wanted to have sex every day
56. The problem is she wanted it to be good
57. I've got one good one in me a year
58. I need time
59. I need prep
60. One night she wanted to have sex after a curry
61. That's illegal
62. We tried
63. It was awful just having our bellies slapping against each other
64. She's on top
65. I'm holding in a fart
66. It's embarrassing
67. You ever run out of breath during sex
68. It's demoralizing
69. You're there like, I'm finished
70. Did you come
71. No, I'm just finished
72. I'm done
73. Oh, come on, Pleasance, I know you're a theatre bug
74. grow up
75. He's talking about sex
76. But hey, we started drifting apart
77. Didn't have sex as much
78. I remember towards the end, as she switched, I wanted to have sex
79. She didn't, fair enough
80. She said, I don't want to have sex
81. I just don't feel sexy
82. I don't think I've ever
83. I felt sexy
84. I can't remember a time where I've hopped out of the shower, caught a glimpse of my pale, hairy, ginger body and thought, well, well, well, she is a lucky girl, isn't she
85. Hitting this sweet piece daily, bow
86. Not even during sex do I feel sexy, I feel grateful
87. Give a cool glimpse of yourself having sex
88. Oh, my God, I'm so pasty
89. I look like a haunting
90. Jesus, paranormal shag-tivity going on in there
91. One time I slept with a Nigerian girl
92. We were 60, 90
93. We looked like the yin-yang symbol
94. Yeah, both finished at the same time, though
95. How's that for balance
96. You guys have been really lovely
97. You have
98. Appreciate you
99. That wasn't about class
100. Why am I going to laugh at that
101. If you want to follow me, my name's Ali Woods
102. I used to like my name, Ali Woods, right, until I did a gig in Glasgow where the MC there introduced me by going, ladies and gentlemen, now time for a man whose name is two places you can get molesterin'
103. Ali Woods
104. It was especially annoying as well because I actually changed my name to Ali Woods
105. It's not my real name
106. My real name is Church, your uncle's house
107. You guys have been great
108. Take care
