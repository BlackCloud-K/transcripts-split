1. And I know when I'm really in love and feel really stable in a relationship, and I don't know if anyone else does this, but as soon as I'm really comfy in it and feeling really in love, I start playing a game
2. And the game is called Would You Still Love Me If
3. I found my person
4. Yay, thank you
5. And I don't want to get soppy, but I'll tell you the exact moment I knew I wanted to spend the rest of my life with him, right
6. So, we was in his flat
7. He turns to me out of nowhere and he says, the most poetic thing I've ever heard come out of a human's mouth, right
8. In a sentence, he captured everything I wanted in my life
9. He said this, right
10. He just looked at me and he went, why is it
11. Why is it we don't put butter on chips
12. Mind blown, why don't we
13. We know potato and butter goes so well
14. This boy has seen through the matrix
15. He's a keeper, he's the one
16. And I know when I'm really in love and feel really stable in a relationship, and I don't know if anyone else does this, but as soon as I'm really comfy in it and feeling really in love, I start playing a game
17. And the game is called, would you still love me if
18. Does anyone play it
19. Yes, good, good, good
20. If you don't play, it's really simple
21. So you just turn to the person you love and you submit them to psychological testing
22. but in a cute way
23. And you can say anything because there's only one right answer
24. So you say anything like, would you still love me if my mouth was a bumhole
25. And they have to go, yes
26. And then you go, oh, brilliant
27. Kiss, kiss, kiss
28. It's great
29. And one day, we were sat doing our favorite thing in the entire world, which just happens to be watching ITV's The Chase
30. Have you seen The Chase
31. Yes, we love The Chase
32. We got a favorite chaser
33. Yeah, Mark LaBette the Beast, right
34. We love Mark LaBette the Beast
35. When he comes on, we've got a chant
36. Mark LaBette gets you wet
37. We love Mark LaBette the Beast, right
38. So we sat in his flat watching Mark LaBette the Beast
39. We had a big bowl of buttery chips
40. Life was good
41. So I turned to him feeling very, very in love and I say, babe, would you still love me if I had Mark LaBette the Beast from The Chase's Hair
42. I was very confident, sat back, waited for my delicious yes, and he went
43. he doesn't know how to play the game
44. Silly
45. Let me explain
46. I was like, no, sorry, you don't get it
47. So basically, it's all me
48. Everything's exactly the same
49. It's all me
50. All me, who you love
51. Everything's exactly the same
52. The only difference, the only tiny little difference is I've got Mark Labette, the beast from the chase's hair
53. And he went, oh
54. No
55. Do you just want to, let's just pause the chair for a sec
56. Yeah
57. No, no, I know it's a game
58. I am having fun
59. I am having fun
60. I'm not taking it seriously
61. No, I'm just, no, it's just interesting to me
62. It's just, no, I'm just saying it's interesting
63. Can you just put the chips down
64. It's just interesting to me
65. that you wouldn't love me if I had short, black, spiky, gelled hair
66. No, I just found that
67. No, I'm not taking it seriously
68. I am having fun
69. I know it's a game
70. I'm just saying
71. It's weird, isn't it, that you wouldn't love me if I had short, black, spiky, gelled hair
72. And he said, Amy, you've got this wrong
73. Of course
74. Of course I would love you if you had short, black, spiky, gelled hair
75. But that's not what you're asking me
76. You're asking me if I would love someone who went into a hairdresser's and specifically asked for Marc Labette, the beast from The Chase's hair
77. And I wouldn't
78. And I said, well, that is fair enough, yeah
79. That is fair enough, you know
80. And then I broke up with him, because you've got to make a choice when it comes to Mark Labette
81. Does he get you wet
82. Does he not pick a lane
83. I will say, this won't make the edit, but I found out, but last week, did you know Mark Labette, the Beast from the Chase, has married his own cousin
84. Did anyone know that
85. I think that's absolutely fascinating
86. Imagine having such an incredible grasp of general knowledge
87. I've no idea of your own family tree
88. Fantastic
89. You've been so lovely
90. Thank you so much for having me
91. Have a good evening
92. See you later
