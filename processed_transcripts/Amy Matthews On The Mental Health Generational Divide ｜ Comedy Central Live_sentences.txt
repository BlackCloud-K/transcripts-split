1. I had a lovely friend come up to me once and be like, oh gosh, you suffer with anxiety
2. How does that affect your daily life
3. I had to look her in the eye and be like, I don't know, some days I'm just walking down the street and I suddenly remember that in primary school, I thought Holly Willoughby was pronounced Holly Willoughby
4. And then for the rest of the day, my chest feels like it's made out of the wind
5. Hello
6. Hello
7. Are we doing really well
8. Good, good
9. I'm trying to sort of gauge demographic-wise who we've got in the room
10. Could you give me a cheer if you were born or raised in the 90s
11. Oh, okay
12. Hello, fellow renters
13. How are we
14. Very nice to have you in
15. It's exciting
16. We've been going long enough now as a generation that we've got generational markers, which I think is quite fun
17. The first is that apparently we're not really having kids very young
18. Yeah, because we've looked around and gone, I don't think so
19. You know, I think it also doesn't help that we were raised in the 90s, and I think 90s parenting was uniquely insane
20. I don't know, have you ever tried to sort of explain it to somebody who wasn't raised at that time
21. It's quite difficult, because it's a very particular flavour of mad, isn't it
22. It's not like 50s parenting, where, I don't know, if you spoke after 6pm, you'd get punched or something
23. I don't know what they were doing back then
24. It's why they're all so cross on Facebook now
25. But it's not their fault, OK
26. We've got to be nicer
27. But it's also not quite 2000s parenting, is it
28. You know, where you get to call your mum a knobhead and she just has to stand there and go, oh, he's so creative
29. A very specific point between those two extremes, 90s parenting, isn't it
30. I don't know
31. They'd offer you dessert after dinner on a Sunday
32. So nice
33. Then you ask what it is and they say the six most disappointing words in the English language
34. There's a yoghurt in the fridge
35. That is 90s parenting in a nutshell
36. I thought Lucozade was medicine until I was 14 years old
37. What were they doing, man
38. On an unrelated note, we're apparently the most mentally ill generation
39. That's a bit of fun, isn't it
40. Very exciting
41. Yeah, is any lunatics in
42. Yes, there we are
43. Very exciting
44. Apparently, my personal flavor is anxiety
45. Yes
46. Boring
47. The one that everyone's got
48. No, thank you
49. It's the one, isn't it
50. It's the worst one
51. Obviously, it's not the worst one
52. Christ
53. But it is like it's the most cringe of the mental illnesses, isn't it
54. It's so bad
55. It's so lame
56. I had a lovely friend come up to me once and be like, oh gosh, you suffer with anxiety
57. How does that affect your daily life
58. I had to look her in the eye and be like, I don't know
59. Some days I'm just walking down the street and I suddenly remember that in primary school, I thought Holly Willoughby was pronounced Holly Willoughby
60. And then for the rest of the day, my chest feels like it's made out of the wind
61. It's the sh**test one
62. So sh**t
63. So lame
64. And I feel very comfortable talking about it
65. Don't worry
66. Very, very comfortable talking about it
67. Fear not
68. Because I don't know if you know, but there used to be a stigma around mental health
69. Do you remember it
70. I think we've solved it
71. I don't know if any of you have met anybody under the age of 22 recently, but they are extraordinary
72. You just go up to one for the first time and you're like, oh, hello
73. Nice to meet you
74. I like your jeans
75. Don't know how to speak to these people
76. And they reply immediately
77. She was going, oh my God, thank you so much
78. Yeah, I actually had to start wearing skirts because of the generational trauma attached to my Celtic lineage and the fact they always wear kilts
79. So I just exclusively wear jeans now
80. These ones are actually really great because they're ankle grazers
81. It's super because it means you get to see my tattoo there
82. It's of a girl drowning in oil
83. That's to symbolize my lifelong battle with depression, but also the sort of larger global trauma that we're all living through because of the ecological disaster
84. Anyway, it's been so nice to meet you
85. Bye
86. They're amazing
87. They're amazing
88. They're amazing
89. On one hand, they are amazing
90. On the other, we could probably tone it down just a little bit, just a smidgen, just to, let's regain some shame
91. Talk about it on stage like a normal person
92. Don't worry, I'm not in that camp of people, otherwise, you know, the opposite
93. People are like, oh, everyone's very sensitive now, aren't they
94. Everyone pathologizes everything
95. We never used to have this kind of stuff, and it was much more difficult in my day, and we just used to get on with it
96. That's not true
97. All that's happened is every single generation, every single era, every single point in history has just had a slightly different set of challenges
98. That's all that is
99. So think about it
100. If you were alive in ancient Egypt, every time you wanted to use a letter A, you had to draw a falcon
101. Imagine how long it'd take them to scream
102. I think anxiety is one of the most inventive of the mental illnesses
103. I really do
104. It's very imaginative
105. If you've got it, you'll know
106. It's always finding fun, new ways to present itself
107. I genuinely, last year, snored myself awake in the middle of the night because my brain just decided to go
108. Oh my God, if all the grapes these days are seedless, how are we going to make new ones
109. That's the rest of the night gone, that is
110. And my gift to you good people this evening is that now you're all quite worried about that too
111. I'm sorry
112. But I'm trying to get much better, you know, take a leaf out of the younger people's book, because they're so good at talking about stuff like that
113. They talk about going to therapy like they're going to the dentist
114. It's incredible
115. So, you know, to honour them, I'll be very vulnerable with you guys today
116. If I'm being totally honest with you, I am going to be
117. After spending slightly too much money on therapy, I did realise I can solve most of my bad mental health days just by listening to ABBA for a bit
118. LAUGHTER Sorry if we've got any ancient Egyptians in
119. That's the band Falcon Foot Foot Falcon
120. Let's not leave anyone out
121. Yeah, I think that is the note I'm going to leave you on, I think
122. I've been Amy Matthews
123. I'll see you again soon
124. Thank you
