1. Comedy Central presents Amy Schumer
2. Look at this
3. This is amazing
4. I can't believe what a big theater
5. I don't even know which way to face in here
6. It's like sex
7. No, but really, I feel like crying
8. It's like sex
9. I just can't
10. Wow
11. Thank you for coming
12. Welcome
13. I'm so excited about this
14. This is amazing
15. And I just want to get something off my chest just right off the bat
16. I'm a Jew
17. Really
18. OK, now you guys are just phoning it in
19. No, but seriously, any Jews here
20. Any
21. A couple
22. All right, not bad
23. Kind of half for New York
24. I guess the rest of us are out running the world
25. But it's good you guys are here, too
26. You're really a Jew
27. You're so pretty
28. God, I love it
29. It's so good
30. You can't even see your horns
31. This is fun
32. This is great
33. And I just went to our homeland for the first time
34. Have you guys ever been to Miami
35. That is where the chosen people are, if you didn't know about it
36. Oh my God, I had no idea
37. Miami is crazy
38. I'm never going back there
39. Everyone there was gorgeous
40. Gorgeous, right
41. I do okay in New York, you know, for a comedian
42. I'm bringing the thunder up here, okay
43. Comic
44. Come on, yeah
45. I usually do okay
46. In New York, I'm like a six, like seven with all the padding
47. But in Miami, I was like a negative three
48. People were like, what the is that
49. Throwing up on their motorized wheelchairs
50. Children were crying
51. I was like, Beyonce calls it jelly
52. They were like, that's cottage cheese, bitch
53. Do some lunges
54. I was like, oh my God, everyone's hot
55. Like they're homeless people are hot in Miami
56. They're not our bird obsessed, weird homeless
57. I made out with a homeless guy by accident
58. I had no idea
59. He was, like, really tan
60. He had no shoes on
61. I just thought it was, like, his thang, you know
62. I'm like, he's probably in a band
63. My friend's like, he probably doesn't have a home, but
64. And the way I found out, we were, like, sitting on this bench, and we were, like, kissing, you know, or, like, doing it
65. I don't remember
66. Because it's, like, so bright down there, but
67. I was like, listen, let's take this party back to your place, right
68. He's like, bitch, this is my place
69. It was sad
70. It was a hard time for me
71. Hard time
72. And they have these things in Miami
73. I don't know if you guys have ever seen them before
74. I'd never even heard of them
75. They have those little Cuban people
76. I am obsessed
77. Obsessed
78. I met my first Cuban guy
79. Ladies, listen to this name
80. Cesar
81. How sexy is that
82. So sexy
83. I'd never even seen him before
84. Just gorgeous
85. He's 311
86. I don't care
87. I'm like, what, do we have to go to amusement parks
88. We'll work it out
89. And the way I met him, crazy, my little Cuban cigar, we're at the hotel restaurant
90. And I was just trying to order a corn muffin for breakfast, you know, minding my own business
91. And the waitress is like, oh, he just got the last corn muffin
92. We only have chocolate chip left
93. Cesar hears this and he comes over and he's like, you can take the corn muffin
94. I will have the chocolate chip
95. I'm like, how cute is this guy
96. But you know, we're not allowed to trade with you guys
97. So what
98. Like, I make the rules
99. Like, I'm
100. It's really hard
101. Ugh
102. I've been drinking a ton
103. You guys drinkers
104. Yeah
105. Thank you
106. Good
107. She's like, no, actually, I have my together
108. I hope your car flips over
109. But, um
110. No, you're cute
111. But I do
112. I drink so much
113. And I black out when I drink
114. Is that the worst
115. No, your mind goes to sleep, but your body's like, tonight is my night
116. It sucks
117. Nothing good ever happens in a blackout
118. I've never woken up and been like, what is this Pilates mat doing out
119. You guys
120. Never
121. I've never, like, rolled over and been like, who's this fella
122. Leonardo DiCaprio
123. Like
124. Maybe in What's Eating Gilbert Grape
125. Um
126. I'm like, who is going to roll this out the door
127. But no, I have an excuse, actually, why I've been drinking so much
128. I haven't said this out loud yet
129. This is exciting
130. I'm drinking for two
131. Thank you
132. Thank you
133. Wow
134. I mean, just for now, but somebody's being evicted
135. You guys are bad
136. You guys are bad
137. It's a weird time
138. My late 20s, New York, like my friends are just starting to keep them and it's hard
139. They're calling me
140. It's a weird age
141. They're like, hey, I'm pregnant
142. And I still don't know whether to be like, congratulations or do you need a ride
143. Like what
144. Where are we
145. You know
146. And there's nothing more awkward, all right, nothing, than going to the first birthday party of a little girl when you told her mom to get rid of her
147. Because the kid can tell
148. I'm like, here's Tickle Me Elmo, and she's like, you
149. I'm like, oh my God
150. I stand by my decision
151. There was this big ad campaign on the subways last summer for babies
152. Did you see it
153. Not, like, selling them, but taking better care of them
154. And there was this one, and it said, uh, never shake a baby
155. You're just like, uh, how am I supposed to have fun with them, you know
156. Or, like, what if they're judging you
157. They didn't think it through
158. Uh
159. And there's another one
160. It says, it's safest to let them sleep alone, especially if you drink, use drugs, or are overweight
161. Yeah, I thought that was weird too, but if you think about it, if you're drunk, stoned, or really fat in the middle of the night, that baby might look delicious
162. I've eaten weirder things
163. I'll be honest with you guys
164. When I'm drunk, there's no accounting for me
165. I do, ugh
166. But you know what the worst part about my drinking is
167. When I'm drunk, I slur
168. You know, like I say racial slurs, and
169. Wow, nobody likes that at a barbecue
170. But, uh
171. No, I'm totally not racist
172. But I'm getting a really racist vibe from you, is that
173. Just like, what's your least favorite ethnicity
174. No, don't answer
175. Are you serious
176. She's like, I don't care for Pakistanis
177. Let's just keep that to yourself
178. No, I'm not at all
179. My best friend in the whole world is black
180. She's a comic
181. And it's cool because right now she's teaching me how to freestyle rap, which I'm actually pretty good at
182. And I'm teaching her how to freestyle swim
183. I'm like, Marco
184. She's like, I don't know what that means
185. It's a whole process, but we're having fun with it
186. But no, I couldn't be less racist
187. I mean it
188. I was at a party two weeks ago in LA
189. And who walks in but Michelle Kwan
190. Do you know who I mean
191. Ice skater, Olympian, right
192. OK
193. Actually, she kind of like glided in
194. She was like, oh
195. We were all like, bitch, we knew you were coming
196. Just like, chill out
197. She's like carrying a torch
198. We were like, it's over, Sequence
199. So we're talking, she's like, blah, blah, like boring ice skate chatter
200. You know, she's telling me, she's like, it's so hard to get ice time
201. I'm like, your problems are so real
202. I'm like, people have no arms
203. And she's like, ice time
204. So we're talking, right
205. And out of nowhere, nowhere, she tells me that Oliver Stone, you know, the director, she's like, he has this huge Asian fetish, and I find it totally offensive
206. And I'm like, why, Quan
207. That sounds awesome, you know
208. And she's like, well, I'm offended because I'm Asian
209. And I was just like, well, I'm sorry, but I didn't even notice that
210. I didn't
211. I thought you were just like really tired
212. You're awesome
213. Are the Asian people laughing
214. I can never tell
215. No, I totally dealt with racism growing up
216. I was the only Jewish kid in my town and I grew up on Long Island
217. Do you guys know what that means
218. My mom found the one town where we had to be Jews, like, underground
219. She was like, write in this diary
220. I was like, what
221. I'm like, dear Kitty, but, uh, no, I totally
222. The kids didn't call me Amy Schumer
223. They called me Amy Joomer
224. And one summer, I'll never forget this, all the kids took turns throwing handfuls of pennies at me
225. I know, I was like, excuse me
226. This is awesome
227. Oh my God
228. This is like the well-seen in Goonies
229. I was like, make it rain
230. The beginning of DuckTales, I was like, woo-hoo
231. Such a good summer
232. No, I really am
233. I'm cool with all races, all religions, except for some of you
234. And, uh
235. No, but I was on the subway not that long ago
236. There was this little old woman sitting next to me
237. You know when they get, like, really little and old
238. Like, she looked like a raisin
239. I was like, I want to put you in my cereal
240. But anyway, this woman on the subway
241. Guys, when I say she was old, like, she was in Downward Dog
242. I was like, why is your body asking a question
243. But, um
244. So out of nowhere, she asked me, she was like, have you heard the good news
245. And I didn't know what she meant
246. I was just like, no
247. Like, is the morning after pill over the counter again
248. Like, what's
249. For some of us, it's plan A, so
250. I was excited
251. But I'm just like, what's the good news
252. Fill me in, Blanche
253. And she's like, no
254. She was like, come to the Times Square Church
255. She was trying to save me
256. So as nicely as I could, I was like, ma'am, I'm so sorry, but my people are Jewish
257. And she's like, that's OK
258. Your people just haven't found Jesus yet
259. And I was like, no
260. We found him
261. Maybe you even heard the bad news
262. I
263. So hard
264. Thank you
265. Thank you
266. She died in my arms, but, um
267. Really sad, but
268. I watch a lot of reality TV
269. I'll be honest with you guys
270. And I was actually on two reality shows, which is crazy, you know, just to think that out there there was some guy, like, flipping through the channels, being like, hey, I 69ed her on a cruise ship
271. It's
272. No, he's not here
273. I'm always looking, but, uh
274. I miss out on so many great reality shows, because the title throws me off
275. My friends all got really into that show, The Deadliest Catch
276. But I never watched it, because I always just assumed it was about AIDS
277. It's about crabs
278. Don't tune in looking for that big AIDS hour
279. No, some people know nothing about that disease
280. It's really sad
281. Like, my college roommate, Lisa, oh, my God
282. I remember we were freshmen
283. I was like, hey, Lisa, like, you should go get tested, because you're a huge slut
284. You let your friends know, right
285. Not like I was awesome
286. I mean, I thought the freshman 15 was how many guys you were supposed to sleep with, but gained it
287. But I should have known that Lisa was a slut, because the day she moved in, she showed me
288. She was one of those girls who could put her whole fist in her
289. Yeah
290. I'm like, let me hang up my Dave Matthews poster first, please
291. Got these ramen noodles brewing
292. I can't even believe I graduated from college
293. I feel like you know what you're gonna be good at when you're older, based on what you like when you're younger
294. Like, when I was younger, my best friend was Tony, this kid Tony, and he loved rocks
295. He was always, like, playing with rocks, counting them, and now he's a crackhead, so
296. It's amazing, isn't it
297. It's really amazing
298. But the best example is my older brother, because when we were kids, he loved cats
299. Everybody else likes dogs, right
300. No, loved cats
301. And he grew up to be this huge pussy, so
302. It's weird how it worked out that way, isn't it
303. I just, I lost some weight this year thanks to Spanx
304. So yeah, our little secret
305. But there's so much pressure for women to be skinny, right
306. We turn on the TV and who do we see
307. We see like the girls from the hills, right
308. Trying to form thoughts
309. That's how they burn their calories
310. Little Heidi's head's gonna explode
311. Or we see Paris Hilton with the Chihuahua
312. What's its name
313. Nicole Richie
314. It's hard
315. It's hard
316. And the way that these girls keep themselves skinny is awful, isn't it
317. By vomiting or using hard drugs, which I can't afford, so
318. It's hard
319. Um, but, no, usually I feel pretty good about myself
320. Like, I know what I look like
321. Like, you'd bang me, but you wouldn't blog about it
322. I get it
323. I'm fine with it
324. You won't be twittering, like, you won't believe who I'm inside, but it's fine
325. I'm okay
326. I'm fine
327. But it's hard, because I just went through a breakup, actually
328. And I'm not worried about meeting someone else or being lonely
329. I'm just, like, worried about all the pictures
330. But
331. But my mom always told me, you know, ever since I was a little girl, you know, never put your face in them, so
332. That always splits the audience
333. I find out where the slutty's are
334. There's one
335. Good job
336. Oh, God
337. But my mom's always saying really smart things like that
338. Like, you probably heard this one
339. Why buy the cow when the milk has HPV
340. Yeah
341. Wish I'd listened to that one, but here we are
342. I want to be one less, but I'm not
343. Thanks for nothing, Gardasil
344. Ding
345. Do you know what HPV is
346. You will
347. It's this fun party disease, guys
348. People are like, who brought the HPV
349. I'm like, this girl
350. Every couple months, one of my girlfriends will call me, crying her eyes out, without fail, crying
351. Aimee, I just found out I have HPV
352. I feel like such a whore
353. I'm like, what about you sleeping with the swim team in college
354. Like, that didn't ring the whore bell
355. But now you know
356. You don't know what you can catch out there
357. Let me say something normal and not horrible
358. I hate false advertising, okay
359. I do
360. Like, Skittles, taste the rainbow, right
361. No one's ever been like, rainbow, right, you guys
362. Or what's Reese's
363. Oh, there's no wrong way to eat a Reese's
364. Really
365. Like, tell that to my uncle
366. He used to put them in my underwear, right
367. Right
368. All right, maybe your uncles didn't love you
369. Think about it
370. No, I'm sorry
371. That's an inside joke
372. Hey, you guys
373. Who's on Facebook
374. I am
375. Some of you, yeah
376. It's crazy, right
377. It's weird
378. Do you guys remember the thing before MySpace, before Facebook
379. Destiny
380. Remember Destiny, where when you were supposed to run into someone from the past, that's when it happened
381. Now every idiot from high school's like, I'm back
382. We weren't supposed to meet again
383. Stop poking me and inviting me to your weird vampire parties, okay
384. No, I don't want to follow you on Twitter
385. Like, nobody's interested in you
386. I don't want to see you in real life
387. Why would I want to follow you in the imaginary one
388. But gosh, Facebook is weird
389. Anybody can get in touch with you
390. Total strangers write to me
391. A stranger wrote to me last week
392. He's like, hey, Amy, I just pleasured myself looking at a picture of you on Facebook
393. There he is
394. He's not bad
395. He's not bad
396. Good job
397. Could have been worse
398. No, but, you know, just, like, one picture
399. And I just think that's gross, you know
400. But I was just like, well, which one
401. I should probably make it my profile picture
402. What
403. It's weird out there
404. It's hard dating
405. And I really did just have my heart broken
406. And what do your friends do when you have your heart broken
407. They take you out and get you drunk
408. Right
409. And isn't that the worst idea in the world
410. You get drunk and lonely and make out with a PA that goes tanning from Babylon
411. And you're like, why
412. I should have just stayed home, watched Law and Order, the one with the sexually based offenses we all like
413. Oh, man
414. But the guy I was seeing, he was a very cool Catholic guy
415. So he would feel really guilty right after sex
416. So I would pretend like I felt guilty, too
417. I'd be like, oh, I feel really bad
418. Maybe you should go home
419. Because I swear, I found the one guy in Manhattan that loves, like, spooning
420. You know, just hugging all night
421. And I like sleeping by myself, like a swastika
422. I'm just like
423. He's all up on this
424. I can do urban shows, too
425. He's good
426. Very neat for a boy, you know
427. Like, he always cleaned up his mess, no matter where he got it on me
428. And
429. He's Hispanic, so he's like, no, who's the wetback
430. I'm like, hey
431. Still you
432. Get back in the kitchen
433. Those dishes aren't going to do themselves
434. You guys have been amazing
435. Thank you so much
