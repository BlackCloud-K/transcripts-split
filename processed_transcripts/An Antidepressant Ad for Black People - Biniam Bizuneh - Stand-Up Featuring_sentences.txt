1. Yeah, my parents are from Africa, specifically Ethiopia
2. And the cool thing about having immigrant parents is that they'll do American traditions, but they won't do them the right way
3. They'll do them their own way
4. Like when I'd lose a tooth as a kid, there was no tooth fairy
5. Like I'd still get money, but it'd be, I'd hand my dad a tooth and he'd hand me a dollar
6. It was a business transaction
7. I was just selling my dad baby teeth
8. And growing up in an African household, I felt like I was never really exposed to black culture
9. Like, that was never given to me
10. No one ever sat me down and was like, this is earth, wind, and fire, and you're supposed to wear cocoa butter
11. Like, no one ever did that for me, you know
12. Because my parents didn't know anything about that
13. They were too busy cooking Ethiopian food and making my clothes smell like onions
14. Like, Ethiopian food tastes great, but if you cook it in a house, everything in that house now smells like onions
15. Everything, like the cat
16. my Game Boy Advance
17. And I don't mean like if you took a raw onion, cut it down the middle and sniffed it
18. I mean like you take a bunch of onions, put them in a blender, puree that shit, mix it with olive oil, put it on a stove, boil that, hang a shirt on top of that
19. Then let the onion vapors just soak and fester in that shirt
20. Then put that shirt on, and that's what I smelled like going to school in eighth grade
21. I smelled like I had hot boxed with some onions
22. And this is gonna come as a surprise to you, but smelling like onions does not lead to you being the most popular boy in school, okay
23. Nah, that shit made me insecure
24. Like, I'm still insecure now
25. Do you guys ever do this
26. You ever say something in front of people, and then later, when you're by yourself, you'll say it out loud again to see if it sounded okay
27. I do that all the time
28. Even to just one guy, I'll just be like, all right, man, peace
29. Then, like, five seconds later, when he's out of earshot, I'm just like, all right, man, peace
30. Yeah, yeah, that was good
31. That was good
32. It's wild how if you're insecure about something, then someone else points it out
33. You'll just remember that forever
34. Change your behavior from that day forward
35. Like, I have really big eyes
36. And when I was in middle school, my resting eye position was like this
37. I was just walking around like, hi, this is normal, hey
38. And a dude at lunch one day was like, nigga, why you look so surprised all the time
39. And my reaction was to be like, this is my new resting eye position
40. Never gonna catch me looking surprised again
41. just gonna look kinda high for the rest of my life
42. Man, I'm still insecure now
43. I don't feel comfortable doing something until I see someone that looks like me do it on TV or rap about it in a song first
44. I didn't feel comfortable skateboarding until I saw the music video for Lupe Fiasco's Kick Push in 2005
45. If you're not familiar, it's just black people skateboarding
46. And I was like, black people skateboard
47. Well, I'm definitely gonna buy one now
48. You know, it's a positive thing
49. Like there's all these young black kids who now know they could be president because they saw Obama be president
50. I didn't know I could have depression because I've never seen a black dude in a commercial for antidepressants
51. Never
52. It's always some old white woman doing Tai Chi in the park
53. It's on some shit like this
54. There's like a cartoon bouncing ball
55. Even the ball is white
56. Like, just once, I want to see one of these commercials aimed at me, you know, and my demographic
57. Just a commercial for black people written by white people, because you know that's what it would be, right
58. Just like one of those commercials that only comes on during Empire
59. This is what that commercial would look like
60. It'd just be a 22-year-old black dude
61. He's sitting on a basketball court
62. It's in sepia tone
63. It's a sad rap beat playing in the background
64. Staring at a ball in between his legs all sad
65. Maybe he just got dunked on, I don't know
66. He looks up slowly at the camera and says, nigga, ask your doctor about Zoloft
67. That would help the streets so much
68. I don't think antidepressants will ever become a street drug because an antidepressant drug deal just makes no sense
69. This is how it'd go down
70. It'd be like, hey man, I'm looking to get fucked up
71. What you got
72. Oh, I got this new shit you gotta try
73. Wellbutrin
74. Okay, is that a upper or a downer
75. How's it gonna make me feel
76. Check this, bro
77. It just makes everything a little easier to manage
78. Okay, weird, well, I gotta drive later
79. How long does it take to hit
80. 30 days
