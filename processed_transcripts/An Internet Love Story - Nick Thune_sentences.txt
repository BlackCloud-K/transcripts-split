1. I would love to share a love story with you guys
2. This is a love story that actually documents my first experience with love growing up in Seattle, Washington
3. I was 14 years old, and it's titled Instant Messenger
4. The year was 1994, and my dad brought home the first family computer
5. It was an Apple
6. Thanks, Dad
7. He brought it inside, and he put it on the table
8. He said, Nick, I can't set this up
9. I'm too old
10. I grabbed his hand
11. I said, I can do it, Eric
12. He said, call me Dad
13. I said, all right, Dad
14. I had 1,253 minutes of AOL burning in my back pocket
15. My dad said, Nick, you're too young
16. Can't have your own screen name yet, but you can use mine
17. It was a salmon with an ERD at the end of it
18. Salmon Nerd
19. So I got online as Salmon Nerd
20. Found out about chatting pretty quick
21. And that's where I met her
22. NSYNC Hottie 503
23. NSYNC Hottie 503
24. I haught her and she's a smiley face all over me
25. A smiley face on me
26. Sometimes NSYNC Hottie 503 would say stuff and I'd be like, what
27. And she'd be like, JK
28. And I'd be like, LOL
29. Because you guys, I knew she was just kidding
30. But I was literally laughing out loud
31. And if you're doing that while talking to somebody on the internet, you have to tell them
32. I spent most of the day minimizing when my dad walked by
33. InSyncHottie503 told me she was a 22-year-old actress just moved to Hollywood two months ago
34. She was nervous because the next day, which was tomorrow back then, she was going to be on TV for the first time, full house, TGIF
35. She was an extra
36. I told her, hey, I know what it's like to be nervous
37. I have a pretty big next day myself because I'm going out to sea for six months
38. I'm a 25-year-old fisherman in Alaska
39. Deadliest salmon run known to man
40. I wasn't scared because they call me salmon nerd for a reason
41. At one point, I had to go to the bathroom
42. So I wrote BRB and I came back a few minutes later and NSYNC Hottie 503 had written question mark, question mark, frowny face
43. And I said, listen, I'm sorry NSYNC Hottie 503, but BRB means be right back
44. She said, no salmon nerd, I know what BRB means, but I don't know if you are gonna BRB from that salmon run
45. And that's when I said caps lock, don't do this right now
46. to stop yelling at me
47. I said, sorry in lowercase
48. I said, listen, I can't lie to you anymore
49. I'm a 14-year-old kid in Seattle, and I'm scared
50. She said, where's cattle
51. And I was like, you know, that's a stupid abbreviation on my part
52. It's Seattle
53. A few minutes went by
54. No response
55. Sign off, sign on
56. Sign off, sign off
57. Finally, she said, salmonerd
58. And I said, yes, NSYNC hottie 503 dot, dot, dot
59. She said, I know who you are, because I'm your 57-year-old neighbor, Jim
60. NSYNC hottie 503
61. I cry-faced her right after she winky-faced all over me
62. Winky-faced on me
63. She didn't actually do a regular winky face
64. She did a semicolon beginning parenthesis, which is a winky frowny face
65. I don't even know if that's a real emotion
66. I mean, I guess it's kind of like saying, hey, I'm unhappy, but you get it, right
67. Thank you
