1. Do you know what I'm going to do
2. I'm going to move home back into the house
3. I'm going to take you to chemo
4. I'm going to look after you
5. We're going to get through this together
6. And she said, Andrew, you moving home will be worse than cancer
7. Tell you one thing I love about being Irish is this, right
8. Is that if funerals were an Olympic sport, Ireland would win gold medals
9. We are the best at funerals
10. We are the best at funerals
11. Different countries, different cultures have different ways of doing funerals, right
12. Over in India, if you die in India, you could be cremated the same day
13. That's it
14. Gone
15. Cremated
16. Dead
17. Dead, dead
18. Like, 100% dead
19. Like, your phone battery has more f***ing life than you, right
20. Here in the UK, it can be three or four weeks before you're buried
21. Three or four weeks
22. So you'd nearly forget about them
23. You'd wake up in the morning and go, jeez, I have to pick up the kids, I have to go to yoga
24. Bloody hell, I have to bury Steve, right
25. Ireland, we're three days to bury somebody, three days, like a stag or a hen party, right
26. People meet, you haven't seen for a while, a lot of alcohol is involved, and by the end of it, somebody's missing, right
27. That's exactly how it works, right
28. And the reason why I bring this up is because I buried my mom recently, right
29. My mom died of cancer
30. My mom was a great woman
31. She died, she had terminal cancer
32. And I remember when I found out that she had cancer, she had a great sense of humor with it
33. And I think humor is very good when you're, you know, you're dealing with this kind of stuff, right
34. My mom was a psychiatric nurse for 40 years, right
35. So she used to work in trauma
36. And every time, you know, she saw trauma, she'd always use humor to deal with it
37. And when I was living in London, I found out that she had terminal cancer
38. So I rang her up and I went, Jesus, man, I can't believe it
39. Like, do you know what I'm going to do
40. I'm going to move home, back into the house
41. I'm going to take you to chemo
42. I'm going to look after you
43. We're going to get through this together
44. And she said, Andrew, you moving home will be worse than cancer
45. And my dad said, if he's coming home now, there'll be two cancers in the house
46. It's a mad thing to see, right
47. My mom spent the last three months of her life living in a hospice
48. Hospices are amazing places, right
49. With great staff and great care
50. Great living in a hospice as well
51. And I remember when I found out that she was going to the hospice, I didn't realize what to do or how do you deal with this kind of stuff
52. And I didn't even know where the hospice was
53. So do you know what I did
54. I Googled it to find out where it was
55. And I swear to God, I Googled it and there was over a hundred reviews
56. Who the thinks it's a good idea to review a hospice
57. Like restaurants and hotels, I could totally deal with
58. But a hospice, I saw one review, my mate John went in for a week, never came out, two stars
59. I don't understand
60. What next, 20% off your next day
61. I don't think that's gonna happen
62. I do miss my mum though
63. The thing about my mum is she was great
64. She was very liberal, very liberal and very traditional
65. And what she would do is she would teach me loads of things about life as well
66. And sometimes her liberal ideas and her forward thinking ways and her traditional ways as well, they never synced
67. They never synced as one idea
68. She was very progressive, but very traditional
69. One of her ideas was this
70. She believed that gay men in Ireland should be allowed to get married in the Catholic church
71. But she thinks one of them has to wear a white dress
72. And you know what, guys
73. I agree with her
74. I think gay men should be allowed to get married in the place where they work
75. It's mad, innit
76. But there's small things you do as you get a bit older and you're kind of like dealing with all that kind of stuff is that there's certain things that I pick up off my mum as well, which is great, was my mum used to leave the front door, go to the car, open the door and then go back up to the front door just to double check that it was locked
77. It's like what parents do, you know, mums do, right
78. I remember one day I was out in London, I lived here for 16 years and then I moved home when I got parole and I went back home, loved living here
79. I only fly over now just to use the NHS, but like, it's free to us, isn't it
80. But the amazing thing about it was that I remember my mum rang me up one time and she said to me, are you out in London
81. I said, I am, yeah
82. Have you got the keys to my house in London
83. I said, yeah, I have them in my pocket
84. They're on my own keys
85. She goes, right, don't be bringing those keys out in London
86. I don't want my house keys in London
87. I said, why, what will happen
88. Well, somebody could rob them
89. I said, I'm in London
90. You're in Ireland
91. Do you really think someone in London is going to pick up those house keys, figure out where you live, get on a plane, fly to Ireland and rob your house
92. She goes, you can't be too careful
93. You know what the irony is, guys
94. You go to my mom's house, right
95. You walk up to the drive, go through the gates, straight up to the door
96. There's a step there, and on the left, there's a purple flower pot, right
97. It's just below the left window, okay
98. Right below the number
99. If you lift that flower pot, a set of keys right under there
100. My mom lives at 23 Carriglione Road, Carriglione County, Cork
101. Off you go
102. All you'll find in that house is a stainless stair lift and a house full of religious bigotry
103. Right, that's all it is
104. So, I'm only joking
105. Thank you
