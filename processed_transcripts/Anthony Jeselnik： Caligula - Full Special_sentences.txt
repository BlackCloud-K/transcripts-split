1. Anthony Jeselnik
2. Anthony Jeselnik
3. I know, right
4. Thank you, guys
5. So great to be here in Chicago
6. I really do love this town
7. I actually once went on a date with a girl from Chicago
8. This was like 10 years ago, back before I was even a comedian yet
9. Back then, I was just a regular old piece of like you guys
10. But I'll never forget this date
11. We meet up at a bar
12. We start drinking
13. We start talking
14. We're laughing together
15. We're connecting
16. It was great
17. But then we leave the bar
18. We go back to her place
19. And as soon as we walk in the front door, she passes out cold on her couch
20. Now, I went to college
21. I knew I had a million options
22. But I'm a gentleman
23. So I did the smart thing
24. I just got a blanket, I tucked her in, and I left her a note that said, you got raped
25. Thank you
26. I feel like it's very important, very important to open up my show with a rape joke
27. Just to see what kind of crowd I'm dealing with here
28. You guys are gonna be great
29. But if you were upset or you were offended in any way, please don't worry
30. I've only got two more rape jokes
31. And I wait about 15 minutes
32. But don't think I'm a bad person for making that joke
33. Don't think I'm a bad guy for saying that
34. I'm a good guy
35. Like, I would never hit a woman
36. I would never hit a woman
37. Even if she had a knife or a stutter
38. It's not how I do business
39. In fact, I might be one of the greatest guys of all time
40. Like I've got a kid in Africa that I feed, that I clothe, that I school, that I inoculate for 75 cents a day
41. Which is practically nothing compared to what it costs to send them there
42. You guys are doing great so far
43. I love performing in Chicago
44. The only weird thing about performing in Chicago for me is after all my shows, everybody just wants to do drugs with me
45. I'd be like, Anthony, that was hilarious
46. I got a joint on me
47. Let's go smoke it
48. Hey, Jesselnik, amazing job, as usual
49. I've got mushrooms in my backpack
50. Let's eat them
51. And I've got to keep telling them the same thing I'm going to tell you guys right now
52. Hey, ass
53. I'm famous
54. Give it to me
55. I think my friend Jeff is gay
56. I don't know
57. I'm so bad with names
58. Smart crowd
59. When I was a kid, My friends and I got arrested for vandalizing a graveyard
60. $10,000 in damages
61. But we had a great lawyer who knocked it down to criminal trespassing and necrophilia
62. I make a lot of jokes about death
63. Because it's hilarious
64. My whole family's like that, kind of
65. In fact, well before I was even born, my great grandmother threw herself in front of a bus
66. Police tried to say she was committing suicide, but the family knew that she was just trying to stop civil rights
67. Yesterday, I accidentally hit a little kid with my car
68. It wasn't serious
69. Nobody saw me
70. And people get weird when kids die
71. No, that's a fact
72. Like about a month ago, some kids in my neighborhood were playing hide-and-go-seek, and one of them ended up in an abandoned refrigerator
73. That's all anybody talked about for weeks
74. I said, who cares
75. How many kids you know get to die a winner
76. I assume you guys all knew who you were coming to see tonight
77. But if you didn't, you sure as know now
78. Like, one thing I've never understood is, like, the foot fetish
79. Like, are you guys together right here
80. Yeah
81. How long you guys been together
82. Five years, wow
83. Do you ever suck on her feet
84. No
85. Would you if you had a different girlfriend
86. Or are you like across the board no feet
87. You don't really mind it, you just don't do it to her because you have mistresses
88. Again
89. Because I'm across the board no feet
90. I once went on a date with a girl where we went hiking
91. Her idea
92. And while we're hiking, she gets bit by a snake in between two toes
93. And I had to suck out the poison
94. So she's dead
95. What's your name
96. Where you from, Bridget
97. The suburbs
98. That shirt narrows it down
99. What do you do
100. I'm a full-time student
101. You're a full-time student
102. Okay, what do you study
103. Psychology
104. Psychology
105. Where do you go to school
106. Brockford College
107. Brockford College
108. So you're not going to be a good psychologist
109. Have you ever been on a blind date before
110. You ever do that
111. No
112. You're lucky
113. I went on a blind date once, just once, and I will never do it again
114. It was the biggest disaster of all time
115. She ended up being a burn victim
116. By the end of the night
117. I mean, it was like the worst
118. I've spent the past two years looking for my ex-girlfriend's killer, but no one will do it
119. My ex-girlfriend owned a parakeet
120. Did you guys hear what I just said
121. She owned a parakeet
122. Oh, my God
123. That thing never shut up
124. But the bird was cool
125. My ex-girlfriend had a lot of, like, really annoying habits
126. You know, I think the worst was she loved to read women's magazines, you know, like Cosmo or things like Cosmo
127. And she would flip straight to the relationship quiz
128. And not only would she present that to me as if it was like a fun activity for us to do together, even though every question is designed to my entire world up
129. But even worse is she would get mad at my answers and make me change them so we'd get the best score
130. Like, I'll never forget the last time we played that game
131. She was like, Anthony, if you could have lunch with anyone in the world, living or dead, who would it be
132. And I said, I don't know
133. Caligula
134. And she goes, really
135. Caligula
136. That's your answer
137. That's what you're going to say to me, your girlfriend
138. Are you sure
139. I said, oh, I'm sorry, baby
140. Let me change that
141. I'd have lunch with you
142. And you'd be dead
143. Yeah, we're not together anymore
144. She's got a new boyfriend now
145. They just moved in together
146. And I've heard rumors that he's abusive, which makes you want to go over there with a baseball bat
147. and then blame it on her boyfriend
148. But I don't want to sound like a misogynist up here
149. My ex-girlfriend wasn't like a bad person, really
150. She wasn't a bad girl at all
151. But she was terrible in bed
152. Terrible in bed
153. I mean, she would just lie there, screaming, no
154. That was rape joke number two, baby doll
155. Yeah, clap it up
156. But my girlfriend now is great
157. My girlfriend now is almost perfect
158. And she hates that I tell rape jokes
159. Hates it
160. Says, Anthony, how could you make light of something as terrible as rape after I told you that I got raped in high school
161. And I said, baby, because I don't believe you
162. My girlfriend and I argue a lot
163. It's mostly her arguing with me kind of thing
164. Like, I should just keep my mouth shut
165. Every fight we get into is my fault
166. I should just keep my mouth shut, but I can't because I'm so funny
167. Like, a couple of nights ago, we go to a party
168. We get trashed, completely wasted
169. We wake up in bed the next morning completely hungover
170. And I know I should just keep my mouth shut
171. But instead, I roll over and I say, listen, baby, don't get mad, but I think your mom tried to have sex with me last night
172. And she hit the roof
173. She goes, Anthony, that's impossible
174. And I said, oh, well, in that case, you should always wear makeup
175. I love that joke so much
176. Here's why
177. Did you guys hear, like, the sounds you made
178. Like, that was the worst thing I've said tonight
179. I've told three rape jokes
180. I like to play pranks on my girlfriend, you know, keep things fresh for me, make me laugh
181. You know, she hates it
182. But like the other night, I put saran wrap over the toilet seat
183. Which doesn't sound that original
184. But she's bulimic
185. I like that you laugh until I look at you and then you stop laughing
186. Because you don't want to give me the satisfaction
187. It's great, you seem like a cool girl in a completely different environment
188. But we make it work, you know
189. Like, how long have you guys been together right here
190. Three years, okay
191. What would you say is like the secret to like a good long relationship
192. Communication, wrong
193. The secret is trying new things together, especially in the bedroom
194. The other night, my girlfriend and I are in bed together
195. She says, Anthony, I want you to pee on me
196. No, I have never thought about peeing on a woman in my entire life
197. Never even imagined it before
198. But then I got the green light
199. and apparently it's my thing
200. Like I just jumped up right away
201. But as soon as that begins, she starts screaming at me
202. Like it's my fault she talks in her sleep
203. No big deal for me
204. My girlfriend yells at me all the time
205. She yells at me all the time
206. And again, I'm a gentleman
207. I never think it's okay to yell back at a woman no matter what
208. I mean, you saw how I handled that , right
209. I never think it's okay to yell back at a woman
210. But the other night, she yelled at me for so long and so loud that the cops came to the door, which is embarrassing because now I've got to answer my own door and say, officers, I'm so sorry
211. There is no reason for you to be here tonight
212. I already tased her
213. I've got this friend named Kevin
214. I call him a friend
215. More of an acquaintance, really
216. One of those people who think they're way better friends with you than they actually are
217. Like the other day, Kevin says to me, hey man, you know what I like to do when I'm all by myself and no one's around
218. And before I can say hey, we're not really friends
219. He says, I like to take peanut butter and smear it all over myself and then let my dog lick it off
220. I said, dude, you have got to get yourself a girlfriend
221. I'll trade you mine for that dog
222. Being a comedian is the greatest job in the world
223. Like, greatest job in the world once you get to my level
224. The only thing I don't like is all the travel
225. I'm always flying somewhere, always in an airport
226. Even flying into Chicago a couple days ago
227. Two and a half hour flight delay
228. I'm stuck in an airport bar talking to some random ass
229. And I got nowhere to go
230. So I'm like, hey man, what do you do
231. And he says, and I quote, oh, nothing right now, but I used to be a priest
232. As in, oh, , right
233. But I got nowhere to go
234. So we keep talking, we keep drinking
235. Finally, two hours goes by
236. Guy gets up, he says, hey man, I gotta catch my flight
237. But I don't wanna lie to you
238. I used to be a priest, I got kicked out, because I molested a kid
239. Now here's the thing
240. After talking to this guy, and getting to know this guy for two hours, I have to admit, he was actually a really cool guy
241. If you could forget about, you know
242. All that Jesus bull
243. Yeah, that's a favorite
244. I'm probably gonna tell it again later
245. But it's not all bad news with me
246. My grandfather turns 100 years old next month
247. Maybe
248. I'm really skeptical
249. I don't think I ever got over my grandmother's death when I was a kid
250. My grandmother died from a heart attack during my ninth birthday party
251. Literally while she was eating cake
252. And I guess that must have screwed me up a little bit
253. I mean, I still have birthday parties
254. But now I'm just careful what I wish for
255. I'm sure my dad had his problems
256. He had his issues
257. My dad was a big time alcoholic
258. Major league alcoholic
259. Blackout every night kind of alcoholic
260. But to his credit, my dad never once laid a finger on either me or my mom
261. Not once
262. And I don't know if it was just because he loved us so much or if he just hated my sisters
263. But either way, Either way, he was a great dad
264. I remember a tough time for me
265. I was like 10 years old
266. My parents called me into their bedroom
267. They say, Anthony, we want to get a divorce
268. You have to decide which one of us you want to live with
269. And I was a 10-year-old kid
270. I didn't know any better
271. I just said, dad, dad, I want to live with dad
272. It was heartbreaking
273. My mom just looked at the floor and said, well, whatever you want, Anthony
274. And my dad just said, I don't want a divorce anymore
275. And maybe the most uncomfortable moment of my life was when my dad gave me the sex talk
276. God, the old man was into some really crazy
277. But then maybe the greatest moment of my life ever, I think this is like a universal thing for guys, I'm 12 years old, I'm sneaking around my house, and I found my dad's porn in the back of the attic
278. That was a great day
279. That was a game changer for me
280. But then the worst day of my life was the day I found my mom's porn in the back of that video store
281. I told that joke recently on Conan
282. That's right, Conan
283. And immediately afterwards, my mom called me on the phone
284. And she said, Anthony, what the
285. Do you really have to make up a joke that makes me sound like I work in pornography and then say it on Conan
286. That's my least favorite joke that you have
287. And I just said, well, mom, that's only because you haven't heard the other jokes I tell about you
288. That they are not allowed to let me say I'm Conan
289. Per example
290. My mom is crazy
291. People always like to joke, oh, my mom's crazy
292. My mom is crazy
293. Her entire house is filled with nothing but pictures of Princess Diana
294. And they're all from right after the accident
295. Most of them she drew
296. Like, it's really up, you guys
297. And my mom's been having a hard time lately
298. She just found out she has to have both of her breasts removed if she's ever gonna be good at golf
299. Yeah, that can not be easy to hear
300. So I went home to visit
301. I'm from Pittsburgh originally
302. Just hang out with my mom for a little bit, you know
303. Yeah, congrats
304. I want to go home and hang out with her for a little bit, you know, help her out, cheer her up
305. But all my mom cares about now is the lottery and me running errands for her, like, every day
306. Every day, it's, Anthony, go play my numbers
307. Go play my numbers, please
308. I don't want to miss out today
309. Finally, after a week of this, I had to say to her, Mom, are you out of your goddamn mind
310. Don't you know you've got a better chance of getting struck by lightning than me doing you a favor
311. I know you guys have been a great crowd tonight
312. You've gone with me everywhere I've wanted you to go
313. But you've just been sitting there this whole time thinking, Anthony, this is all well and good
314. But where are your offensive jokes
315. Where are your showstoppers, if you will
316. Well, guys, I saved those for the end
317. I'm going to tell you all a series of jokes right now
318. that are going to get increasingly more offensive
319. I like that enthusiasm
320. Let's see how far it carries
321. They say it's easy
322. They say it's easy to make fun of retarded people
323. But let me tell you guys something, it is not
324. You have really got to explain it to them
325. That was the first one
326. Every night my girlfriend comes home from work and she brings with her a houseplant
327. She's like, Anthony, I had to pick this up
328. We need a houseplant in our apartment
329. And every night I make her return it
330. I say, no way, baby
331. You can't take care of a houseplant
332. You couldn't even keep your baby alive
333. Two for two, huh
334. We just found out my little brother has a peanut allergy
335. A peanut allergy, which is very serious, I know
336. But still, I feel like my parents are totally overreacting
337. They caught me eating a tiny little bag of airline peanuts, and they kicked me out of his funeral
338. I feel like some of you guys might be too nice to laugh at some of these jokes
339. And that's OK
340. Not everybody has a great sense of humor
341. You guys would probably love my little nephew
342. He's like six years old
343. So cute
344. I talk to him every day on the phone
345. And he's unbelievable
346. He's got like the greatest imagination ever
347. He's either going to be an incredible artist someday, or he really did get molested
348. I wasn't even laughing about that one
349. I was thinking about what's coming
350. I feel like I need to say, like, I really believe this, that being a mother seems like one of the toughest jobs in the world
351. Like, literally, right below comedian
352. So to me, if a mother does her best, then in my book, she's a good mom
353. Now, my mom did her very best
354. Unfortunately, she was also a terrible person
355. Like my mom for most of her life, and this is true, my mom for most of her life was a Holocaust denier
356. Does everybody know what that means
357. I mean, she couldn't believe the Holocaust happened
358. It's like the worst thing you can be
359. And it was terrible for the entire family to have to deal with
360. Until finally, a couple years ago, we had an intervention
361. And we had a rabbi come into the home, had him walk her through the history of the Jewish people
362. And then he made her watch Schindler's List
363. And after that, my mom did a complete 180
364. Now
365. she can't believe it only happened once
366. I'm not a religious person
367. I would call myself an atheist
368. I don't have a good story behind it
369. I'm just reasonable
370. My girlfriend has got the greatest story behind why she's not religious anymore
371. She said when she was a kid, like 12 years old, her parents nailed a 25-pound crucifix to the wall right above her bed
372. And about two weeks later, in the middle of the night, the crucifix falls off the wall and leaves a two-inch gash in the back of her dad's head
373. Like, whether you laughed or not, you gotta admit, that's a great story
374. Now, this is the ideal time to tell you guys that I love to meet fans after the show
375. I like when people come up and say, Anthony, you're a genius
376. Anthony, best show I've ever seen
377. And that's it
378. I don't ever want to hear anything else
379. If you've got a bone to pick with me over something I've said tonight, instead, you should just shut the up
380. Because seriously, I know more about comedy than you do
381. And you came to see me
382. Like I said, shut the up
383. But still, even after I've just said all that, you still feel like you need to come up and bitch
384. Well, then I will be as polite as I can possibly be
385. However, it is ill-advised
386. because you will end up as a joke in my act
387. Much like the blind guy who came up and complained to me in Seattle after a show
388. He walked up and said, Anthony, Anthony
389. Why didn't you tell any blind jokes tonight
390. I came here to hear blind jokes tonight
391. And I said, well, Here's a blind joke
392. Another good one for me was the lesbian in Portland who ran up after a show
393. And I know she was a lesbian because she ran up and yelled out, Anthony, I'm a lesbian
394. And I thought you were really funny tonight, but you're just lucky you didn't make any lesbian jokes up there, because I would have gotten really mad if you had made fun of any lesbians tonight
395. And I wanted to say to her, hey, do you realize that that makes you a terrible person and that you have no sense of humor
396. Plus, you're an idiot
397. If you felt OK laughing at all the other messed up things I joked about, well, you'd have gotten really upset if I made fun of you or something you cared about
398. And I was gonna say all that
399. But then I remembered, Anthony, she's a lesbian
400. She knows
401. My second favorite post-show interaction of all time had to be, I was in Boston a couple years ago, and a very drunk girl, they're always very drunk, ran up to me
402. And she screams out, you should never make fun of the Holocaust
403. And I said, why
404. You know, just to be a dick
405. And she says, because I lost family in the Holocaust
406. And I said, well, you don't look Jewish
407. And she said, listen ass
408. There are certain lines you're not supposed to cross, certain boundaries you're never supposed to push
409. And I said, hey, hey, hey, I just gave you a compliment
410. But my favorite, the best, most unbeatable, never going to happen again, post-show interaction of all time, had to be just about a year ago
411. I was performing in Orlando, Florida, home of Casey Anthony
412. And this is right after the trial, like immediately after the trial
413. And I said, listen, everybody, I don't understand what the big deal is here
414. Of course, Casey Anthony is innocent
415. If she's guilty of anything, it's killing her baby
416. Now, after the show, I'm taking pictures, signing tits
417. You know how it is
418. And a guy walks up to me
419. totally sober, looking very upset
420. And he says, you need to do me a favor, which is a terrible way to start
421. He says, you need to never tell another Casey Anthony joke ever again
422. And I said, why
423. You know, just to be a dick
424. And he says, I'll never forget this
425. He says, because her daughter, Kaylee Anthony, is my niece
426. And I said, bull
427. At which point he takes out his phone, sadly hits a couple buttons, and he shows me a picture of him holding little Kaylee Anthony in happier times, of course
428. And he says, see
429. See, you son of a bitch
430. And I said, no, man, I believe you
431. I just mean she was your niece
432. Thank you very much, everybody
433. Have a great night
434. Thank you so much
435. All right, you guys, put your hands together
436. Please welcome Anthony Desolete
