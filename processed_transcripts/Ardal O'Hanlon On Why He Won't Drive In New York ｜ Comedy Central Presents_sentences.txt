1. But once you start shaving an area, you just can't stop
2. It grows wildly out of control
3. I'm standing up here at the moment
4. It feels like I've got Don King's head in my underpants
5. I don't know an awful lot about New York
6. I've been here a couple of times
7. I love New York
8. It's a magnificent city
9. The thing I love most about it is its diversity
10. You know, I never knew there were so many different ways of saying you
11. It's fantastic
12. But one thing I wouldn't do here is I wouldn't try and drive in Manhattan
13. You drive like crazy here
14. You know, I don't approve of drink driving, but I'd need to have a few drinks to pluck up the courage to drive
15. You know
16. Yeah
17. It's mad on the roads
18. Now, the most dangerous people on the road are the ambulance drivers
19. They're reckless
20. Now, I've no respect at all for that particular emergency vehicle
21. And the thing I dislike most about the ambulance is the way they have the word ambulance spelt backwards emblazoned across the front of the vehicle
22. Now, the thinking being that you're driving along in traffic and you look in your rearview mirror and you see, oh, there's an ambulance behind me, so I better pull over
23. That's assuming that you haven't heard the incredibly loud siren in the first place
24. You know, they think we're idiots, don't they
25. So whenever I see an ambulance coming towards me, down the wrong side of the street, as they often do, I think to myself, hmm, well, I hear this iron all right, but how can I be sure
26. How can I be sure
27. God, I'm exhausted already
28. I have no energy at all
29. I used up all my energy in my youth running around the house pretending to be a horse, you know
30. I mean, the only exercise I get now would be a vomit on a Friday night, so
31. Keeps me in trim
32. And I had an operation a couple of months ago
33. You know, nothing too serious, just having my pyjamas surgically removed
34. But this operation, it did involve me having my genital area shaved
35. And I was a bit nervous about this at first, but to be honest, I've been doing it ever since
36. It's just all the guys in the ward said I look much younger without it, you know
37. Apparently it takes years off me
38. But once you start shaving an area, you just can't stop
39. It grows wildly out of control
40. I'm standing up here at the moment, it feels like I've got Don King's head in my underpants
41. And that's not a very pleasant thought, you know
42. Especially if you're Don King
43. I'm permanently exhausted
44. I saw a sign on the side of the road the other day
45. It said, tiredness can kill
46. I never knew that
47. Last Saturday I stayed up all night watching movies
48. I could have died
49. Nobody tells you these things
50. I love sleeping
51. I think sleeplessness is the root cause of all the problems in society today
52. People don't get enough sleep
53. You know
54. They work too hard and they're stressed out
55. They make mistakes and commit crimes and grow long beards and run amok in the workplace with automatic weapons
56. I think there should be a Spanish-style siesta in this country
57. Yes
58. Yes
59. There should
60. From about half eleven in the morning until Thursday would be about right
