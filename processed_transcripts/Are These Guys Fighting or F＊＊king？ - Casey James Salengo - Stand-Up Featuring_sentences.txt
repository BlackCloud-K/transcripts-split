1. All right, I fucking love this town
2. Hell of a town, man
3. Just mayhem and chaos in the streets
4. I can't get enough
5. People just fighting and screaming in the street
6. I fucking love it, man
7. I love fights
8. I don't know why
9. My favorite kind of fight to see is two guys who clearly don't want to fight, but neither will back down
10. That gets my blood pumping, baby
11. I love it, because they're just saying wild shit
12. No one knows what's going on
13. I saw this recently, and this one guy Will's yelling at the other guy
14. He's going, suck my fucking dick
15. He's going, suck my dick, asshole
16. And the other guy's going, well, pull it out
17. Pull it out, you son of a bitch
18. He's going, suck my dick
19. Well, pull it out
20. I'm like, where is this
21. I'm going to go
22. He's like, which warrior will yield first
23. He's like, suck my dick, you son of a bitch
24. Well, pull it out, you motherfucker
25. Will, it's out
26. Will
27. I did not foresee this
28. But too late to back down now, all right, you son of a bitch, huh
29. You too scared to come, asshole
30. I knew it, too scared to come
31. I could fucking tell right from the top
32. He's like, I don't know, spit on my balls a little bit, you dumbass
33. Dude, you never fucking suck the dick, you dumb son of a bitch
34. Unbelievable, this guy
35. Anyway, what are you doing after this, huh
36. You like Italian
37. Of course I like Italian, you dumb bastard
38. You dumb son of a bitch
39. I can't believe it
40. This guy
41. You ever thought about getting a house upstate
42. Every day
43. Every goddamn day
44. You ever thought about adopting a dog
45. What about a Weimaraner
46. That's the big gray one, right
47. Yeah, it's a beautiful breed
48. I was watching that thing way too long
49. Hate turned to love is a beautiful experience
50. Speaking of dogs, I just got fired from dog walking
51. Anyone know that was possible
52. You have to hold an animal by a rope
53. I fucked it up somehow
54. Apparently it's because I was hours late and high every day
55. But what the fuck
56. You should be high when you walk a dog
57. It's cool
58. It's very fun
59. Nothing bad would happen
60. I would just get too emotionally attached to the dogs
61. I don't know if you've been higher on a dog
62. It's very fucking fun
63. Like, my boss would call me up, he's like, you're an hour and a half late to your next walk, where the hell are you
64. Cut to me being like, little baby doggie, I love you so goddamn much
65. Gonna kiss you and hug you and squeeze you and please you and rub your tummy so much
66. Where we go, we're gonna fly away
67. Fly up to, through doggie windows, big guys, I don't know
68. A lot of dog owners will put cameras in their house to make sure their dog walkers aren't stealing
69. My people are like, I'm sorry, did you spend 45 minutes trying to get my dog to wear a cowboy hat
70. I was like, I don't know, it was baked
71. I thought it looked good, you know
72. He's got the bone structure
73. He didn't raise them right
74. It's not my fault
75. Other things, I just got married
76. That's pretty cool, huh
77. Read and wait
78. Look at that little daddy, huh
79. Pretty sweet
80. Still getting used to it
81. I still fuck up a lot, my dumb ass
82. I'll come home drunk, you know, two to seven times a week, depending on the season, sure
83. I'm a fun guy
84. And I'll always try to cover it up, but it'll overcompensate way too hard
85. I don't know if anyone does this here, you know
86. I'll be like, kind of fumbling with the keys and I'll like stumble in
87. She'll be like, how was your night
88. I'm like, what an evening it was
89. The moon was on high, sparkling like a diamond
90. Sounds of the city, what a town
91. She's like, you're hammered, aren't you
92. I'm like, indubitably
93. I shall now make a sandwich in the bathtub
94. Good day to you, madame
95. She's cool as hell
96. I'm glad I don't have to be dating anymore
97. It's very scary out there
98. It's no fun
99. I was on the app, swipping and swiping around
100. Swipping and swiping
101. That's kind of what I'm talking about
102. I never know what to say to people
103. I would just say the first dumb thing that popped in my head that I thought was funny and no one else agreed
104. I'd literally say something like, oh no, I got my foot stuck in a jar
105. And no one would respond to that
106. Why would somebody respond to that
107. So then like a day later, I'd be like, whoop, it's out
108. And then no one would respond to that
109. So a day later, I'd be like, oh no, it's back in
110. There's a lot of heat on there
111. My wife loves murder
112. We watch all these murder shows
113. It's great
114. We watch Mindhunter
115. You guys watch that show
116. Very fun, very cool
117. We watch it this season
118. They cover the Atlanta child murders
119. Did you see that
120. If you don't know what that is, a bunch of kids were murdered in Atlanta in the 70s
121. I'll try to make this funny, I promise
122. And they thought they had the culprit because they found this guy's semen at one of the burial sites
123. But it turns out this dude was just beaten off in the woods
124. And I was like, God damn, I've never related to a character more
125. I was like, yeah
126. And I was like, that is some shit I would do right there
127. We've all beat off in the woods, right boys
128. We all beat off weird places
129. I beat off every job I've had, jobs I haven't had yet, you know
130. I've been in the interview like, I'm gonna need a fiver
131. I'll be right back
132. I know there'll be so many questions
133. Imagine you do something like that
134. You masturbate in the woods and you're like, well, that wasn't my proudest moment
135. Probably should wait until I go home
136. I'm just going to go home and try to forget that ever happened
137. And then you go home to your wife and child
138. But then in this case, in the dead of the night, the police rip you out of your home
139. And you're like, well, this went much further than I expected
140. I did not know this was a crime, honestly
141. If that happened to me, I would be so ashamed that they'd get me to the station
142. I would just admit to whatever they were saying
143. I wouldn't even really listen
144. They'd be like, well, well, well, well
145. what were you doing in the woods earlier tonight
146. I'm like, I did it, okay, I'm sorry
147. I just get these urges, my body talks to me
148. They're like, you sick son of a bitch
149. How'd you do it, huh
150. I'm like, you know, normal
151. Just like with my hand, you know
152. They're like, with your bare hands, you sick bastard
153. You're going away for the rest of your life
154. I'm like, well, that seems pretty extreme, but okay
155. I get to jail, my cellmate would be like, wow, you really killed all those kids, huh
156. I'm like, well, that's a pretty conservative way to look at it, but, you know
157. They could have grown up to be something
158. I get beaten to death in prison and be like, convict a child killer
159. Casey Dream Salinga was beaten to death in prison today
160. His final words were, jeez Louise, fellas, this is a bit much
