1. Please help me welcome the host of the Skeptic Tank podcast, Ari Shaffir
2. Okay, this is a quick story about how I understood the lyrics to a song for the first time
3. I went to China last June
4. I got three weeks in China for comedy
5. They sent me there
6. Pretty cool, right
7. Yeah
8. Every once in a while, comedy really pays off
9. Just got to live in poverty for nine years and then get your free trip to China
10. They told me two things
11. I went for comedy, so they told me two things before I went
12. They gave me two rules
13. First rule, they said, no bringing drugs in of any kind, because they said it's punishable by death
14. Yeah, and I was like, how much weed can I bring
15. And they were like, Ari, none
16. And I was like, count our offer, some
17. They were like, don't do it
18. I'm like, I'm bringing pot cookies to the plane
19. You can't stop me
20. The other rule they gave me is they said no making fun of the Chinese government
21. No making any jokes about the Chinese government
22. And I was like, I don't make jokes about the Chinese government
23. get over yourself, Chinese government
24. Nobody's talking about you
25. Here was the cool thing about China
26. Well, everything
27. Here was the terrible thing about all of Asia
28. It's the toilet situation
29. Yeah, so you know the seats that go up and down for men and women, like that seat
30. So they don't have that seat
31. And then they also, they don't have the whole toilet
32. They don't have any of it
33. They don't have toilets
34. They don't believe in it or something
35. They just got holes in the ground
36. Literally, it's like a regular bathroom floor with tiles and everything, and then where the toilet should be is just this hole, and you're supposed to go over it like a college basketball coach, and you're just supposed to squat
37. You're just supposed to squat and shit into this hole
38. And they don't tell you at all
39. They don't tell you about any of it
40. And so I went there, and I was walking around, having a good time, and I got this important phone call from my friend diarrhea, and that's when I really started to hate China because of this toilet situation
41. I run to the bathroom
42. I just sprint to find the bathroom
43. I burst open the door
44. I'm telling you right now, when you open up a stall door and there's no toilet in there, your mind can't even wrap its head around what's happening
45. It's like some sort of optical illusion
46. You know, it's like, which line is longer
47. Like, I don't know, top one
48. You're like, no, same size
49. And you're like, bullshit, measure again
50. Regular bathroom floor, tiles, and then just hole
51. It looks like a union guy was coming to install a toilet, and then it was like, oh, lunchtime, and then he just left
52. And then he forgot to get back to it
53. And then I remember, like, oh, they told me about these, these shit squat toilets
54. That's what you're supposed to do
55. And I realized, right then, I was like, you know what
56. I'm not doing this
57. I was born an American, and I'll die an American
58. And so I left, I walked out, and I got, like, two steps away, and then diarrhea was like, of course you're doing it
59. And I was like, oh, yeah, diarrhea, I forgot about you
60. So I go back into this stall, I close the door, and I'm looking at this hole
61. Here's my first question
62. How far do you take your pants down
63. I've done it, and I don't know what the answer is
64. I have no idea
65. My first thought was, like, take them down to your ankles, because that's how I normally do it, but then you can't do that, because here's the deal
66. I went down, I took them down to my ankles, and then I, like, lined it up
67. And I'm like, hold on a second
68. Like, my asshole is directly above my pants
69. How am I not gonna shit into my pants
70. Unless a heavy gust of wind comes by, I'm for sure gonna shit into my pants
71. So anyway, it's not down to your ankles, I don't think
72. And by the way, the one time you want handicap bars to hold onto, they don't have handicap bars
73. They make you zen about it
74. You just gotta use your core
75. So here's what I did
76. I don't know if this is right or wrong, but I took my shirt off
77. And you know the hook that's on the door of the bathroom cells
78. I just sort of hooked it on there
79. Lowered myself
80. I just gotta do it that way
81. That feels like a shit right now
82. Yeah, I don't know if that's the right answer or not, but that's what I did
83. It seemed to work
84. It seemed to work
85. I mean, I shit that way, so
86. I felt good, too
87. When I did it, I was like, yeah, live like a real Chinese person
88. So anyway, I finished, and I was like, yeah, I did it
89. I got up to wipe, and that's when I found out that they don't offer toilet paper in China
90. Yeah, they don't believe in it
91. I think their theory is, you're the one shitting
92. You clean it up
93. And that's not wrong
94. It's not even that it's wrong
95. I'm just saying, you should warn people
96. You should let people know
97. Like, everyone who lands at the airport with a round eye, they should give them a pamphlet and be like, here, you're gonna have some problems
98. I'm standing there
99. I'm like, what am I gonna do
100. Well, anyway, here's the deal
101. Five days before, I landed in Shanghai
102. I got to a club, the first place I performed, this bar, and the bar owner was like, um, oh, you just got here today
103. And I was like, yeah
104. And he goes, oh
105. And he gave me this packet of tissue paper
106. You know those little travel Kleenex packs
107. And he gave me one of those, and he goes, here, you'll need this
108. It was like Gandalf had come up to me or something, you know
109. And I was like, what will I need it for
110. And he just goes, you'll know
111. And he was right, though
112. He was right
113. I was standing there in that toilet at the Forbidden City, and I was like, where am I going
114. I was like, oh, I got the toilet paper
115. I was so excited
116. Here's the problem, though
117. They don't give you unlimited tissue paper in one of those things
118. They give you six
119. With six, you can't be an American anymore
120. You can't be like, oh, four at a time
121. I love to waste most resources in the world
122. USA, USA
123. Not with six
124. With six, you gotta budget
125. You gotta make every one count
126. You gotta start, like, way from the bottom
127. And then go all the way up to about here
128. Fold
129. Go back
130. Start from the bottom
131. Now we're here
132. I kept doing that
133. Start from the bottom
134. Now here
135. Start from the bottom
136. Now here
137. And that's when I realized what that Drake song was all about
