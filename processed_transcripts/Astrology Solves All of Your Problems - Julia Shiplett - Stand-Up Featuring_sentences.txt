1. Thank you so much
2. It's so good to be here
3. Oh my gosh
4. Happy Virgo season
5. Yeah
6. That was a test
7. Now I know where my enemies are
8. Got your ass
9. Got your ass
10. I'm with you
11. I've been dabbling in astrology a bit lately because I'm not well
12. And I am unfortunately a Gemini
13. also known as a two-faced bitch according to my birth chart and some other people but What I like about astrology is that it sort of lets you surrender to something bigger than yourself, you know
14. A higher power
15. It's like religion in that way, right
16. You know, it reminds you you're not in charge of everything
17. And frankly, not everything is your fault, okay
18. For example, I know that the reason I can't really date anyone for more than three months has nothing to do with commitment issues
19. It's because I'm an air sign, you know
20. i don't have a fear of intimacy i had an eclipse on my birthday do you understand i'm sorry my parents did it on a crisp fall day and now this is my personality take it up with the sky take it up with the sky um No, I do like astrology
21. I just think it's best paired with some therapy on the side
22. I am in therapy
23. Anybody else in pain
24. Okay, good
25. I've been in therapy for a few years now, and I'll be honest, I was really scared to start
26. I was skeptical
27. I don't come from a therapy family
28. We did not grow up talking about our emotions in my house
29. I'm the product of a religious immigrant and a real salt-of-the-earth Midwesterner
30. Those are two very different people who both happen to think therapy is witchcraft
31. They don't get it, they don't get it
32. My very Christian Chinese mom will say things to me like, why would you pay a stranger to listen to your problems when the Lord's been listening for free this whole time
33. And then my German Irish dad from Ohio will say things like, when I'm sad, I walk into the forest
34. And I don't come out till I feel better, so
35. We just hope he returns soon
36. It's been weeks and we miss him a lot
37. I miss my dad
38. I can't help but notice there's a lot of cuties here tonight
39. A lot of cuties
40. Yeah, I feel like this is just a good time to let you all know that I am bi
41. Myself, I'm by myself, I'm single
42. Very single
43. I was pretty much writing solo throughout quarantine
44. Any other
45. decorated war heroes among us
46. Gorgeous
47. Yeah, I'm trying to get back out there, date a little bit, you know
48. I'm glad the world is opening back up again because personally, I found the pandemic to be pretty tough
49. That's something just sort of unique and interesting about me
50. I will say though, now that I'm leaving my apartment a lot more often, I have been locking myself out a lot lately
51. And I'm sorry, but is anyone else furious we still do physical keys
52. Right
53. We're all just carrying little pieces of scrap metal on us at all times to sleep in our own beds at night
54. It's 2021
55. We can unlock our phones with our faces, but we're still fucking around with before Christ door technology
56. That's insane
57. We should riot
58. God
59. God
60. I locked myself out recently and I was standing in my hallway like an idiot waiting for my landlord to come back and let me in
61. And literally four feet away is my living room where I have an Amazon Echo, all right
62. I have an evil little machine I can talk to for answers
63. And in that moment, through the wall, I was able to be like, Alexa, what's Zoe Kravitz's birth sign
64. But I couldn't get into my own goddamn home
65. She's a Sag, by the way
66. She's a Sag
67. I have been celebrating the return of gossip in all of our lives
68. Right
69. Yes
70. Absolutely
71. Absolutely
72. You know, we were deprived of it for a good year and a half, and now it's coming back hot
73. It's back, baby
74. Clap it off if you also love some gossip
75. All of you who did not clap are lying to yourselves and everyone around you
76. It's true
77. You love it
78. Listen, we all like gossip
79. Who doesn't
80. People talking to people about people
81. What's there not to love
82. I think gossip is natural
83. I think gossip is healthy
84. I think gossip is self-care
85. Okay, that was toxic
86. Toxic Gemini behavior
87. But
88. No, it's true
89. I think, you know, people have been gossiping since the beginning of time
90. They really have
91. And I feel like there's this weird sexist idea that only women like to gossip
92. As if conspiracy theories aren't just gossip delivered confidently as fact
93. It's the same thing
94. It's the exact same
95. The only difference between conspiracy theories and gossip is how you say it, right
96. A conspiracy theorist will say something like, Hillary Clinton drinks the blood of newborn babies
97. Yeah, I was there
98. I saw it with my own eyes
99. No, he wasn't
100. But a drunk gossipy woman will be like, Well, I heard from Sasha, who heard from Terry, that Hillary may be throwing back a bit of the baby blood these days, but you didn't hear from me
101. You didn't hear from me
102. She names her sources
103. She gives credit where credit's due
104. That's just a good journalist
105. You know who I think must have been the biggest gossips of all time
106. Famous historical military leaders
107. Yeah
108. Genghis Khan, Napoleon, Alexander the Great
109. You know, you gotta be in other people's business to brutally build an empire, okay
110. You do
111. Think about it
112. Really, all those guys did all day was be like, what are those boys doing over there
113. Let's find out
114. You have news from the mountain
115. Give it to me, you know
116. Listen, I just think that if another grown man has ever galloped up to you on horseback with a secret message, you're a nosy bitch who lives for drama
117. That's all I'm saying
