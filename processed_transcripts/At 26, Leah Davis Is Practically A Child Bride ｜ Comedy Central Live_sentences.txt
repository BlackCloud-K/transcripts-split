1. Like, I miss the days when Lidl and Audi were the UK's second biggest dirty little German secret
2. Do you know what I mean
3. Your secret's safe with me, royal family
4. Don't sweat it
5. Don't sweat it
6. Not that some of you could, even if you wanted to
7. Good evening, broken Britain
8. How are you holding up
9. You doing okay
10. Okay-ish
11. It's not great, is it
12. It's not great
13. Everything is so expensive and the supermarkets do not care
14. They don't at all
15. I mean, I need a six-part Stacey Dooley Investigates documentary on the disappearance of Tesco value and the rise and rise of the club card cult
16. It's not good
17. I mean, the club card used to be our friend, didn't it
18. It used to be this passport to a world of adventure
19. You know, if you save up enough points, you can go to Thorpe Park or Alton Towers or Spearmint Rhino
20. And now, now even the rubbish supermarkets have gone bougie on us, haven't they
21. Like, I miss the days when Lidl and Audi were the UK's second biggest dirty little German secret
22. Do you know what I mean
23. I mean, your secret's safe with me, royal family
24. Don't sweat it
25. Don't sweat it
26. Not that some of you could, even if you wanted to
27. But there are just some things in this life that you can't go cheap on, okay
28. Unless, of course, you want to spend an hour in Finsbury Park with two women who look a bit like Miss Trunchbull in a basement that looks a bit like the Chokey
29. I actually wouldn't recommend buying a £12 Brazilian wax from Woucher
30. Do we know Woucher
31. Do you know Woucher
32. Yeah, it's that website where you can buy experiences and products and lifelong trauma for a fraction of the regular price
33. I mean, the red flags were there with this Brazilian wax
34. I should have known better, right
35. Number one, your average Brazilian wax, it costs like 30 to 40 pounds
36. So even Martin Lewis, the money-saving expert, would say, Leah, 12 pounds is too cheap
37. number two number two um there is only meant to be one person in the room doing the treatment not two terrifying women built like bottles of sham board and 250 viewers at home on the facebook live stream and number three number three this one um this one is crucial um only one of you is meant to be naked from the waist down I think what I'm trying to say is I was tricked into my first ever three-way by Woucher
38. No, disclaimer, disclaimer
39. The last bit was a joke
40. The last bit was a joke
41. Had my first ever three-way years ago
42. Come on
43. Come on, man
44. But I get waxed down there, right
45. Because I've been conditioned to believe that, you know, that's what men prefer
46. And, you know, also it was becoming very hard to urinate
47. Just matted
48. Tangled
49. But it did work, though, because I got myself a husband
50. I got married last year
51. Thank you
52. Thank you
53. I got married at the age of 26, which does, by law, make me a child bride
54. We exist
55. But I suppose the most shocking thing about my whole wedding situation wasn't even necessarily the age that I was when we got married
56. As I said, I was 26, but my husband was 28
57. yeah yeah no you can say it you can say it how's that even legal i know i know i know um no go on what was that at the back that's that's like two different generations exactly that's what i said that's what i said i said babe this is weird this is weird this is like thatcher versus thunberg this is like black adder versus black lives matter I'm struggling to bridge the age gap, I am
58. But 26 is quite young to be getting married in this day and age, isn't it
59. Like, I suppose it's not young, young
60. Like, I wasn't young enough to, like, f*** Leonardo DiCaprio, but
61. Definitely, definitely young enough for people to assume that religion must have played a part in this somewhere, which, you know, I understand
62. I understand
63. But a lot of people in the age of dating apps, they do like to ask, how did you guys meet
64. How did you meet
65. And yes, we did meet online
66. Very cliche
67. But my husband still insists that it still counts as love at first sight
68. You know, it's still love at first sight
69. When he clicked join on that Facebook live stream, he said, I will marry you
70. That woman
71. That is the woman I will marry
72. And, you know, here we are today
73. The best £12 I ever spent
74. Thank you
75. Thank you
76. I do think, though, that we are in it for the long haul
77. I think we're going to stick together
78. He's a great guy
79. I love this guy, right
80. But I've only really got the one complaint between me and you
81. This guy is obsessed with oral
82. hygiene he brushes his teeth like he no longer wants to match his own dental records just so much aggression in there and the aftermath my mirror looks like a premier in headboard under one of those UV lights just white mess as far as the eye can see you know and if that carries on then call me Nigel Farage because I will be voting to leave that is my time guys you've been lovely my name is Leah Davis
