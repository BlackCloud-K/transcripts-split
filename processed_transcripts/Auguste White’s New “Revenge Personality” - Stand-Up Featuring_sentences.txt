1. I got an IUD this week
2. Yeah
3. I am not seeing anybody right now, but you know what they say, dress for the job you want, right
4. Not the job you have
5. Yeah, I'm single, if you can believe it
6. And being single, it has changed my priorities in a way that I'm not super proud of
7. Okay, I'll give you an example
8. We all remember two years ago, the racial uprising, right
9. I went to a protest
10. I went to a Black Lives Matter protest
11. And, you know, it was insane out there
12. Okay, yeah, thank you
13. Goddamn
14. No, we go to this protest and it's crazy out there, right
15. We got like tear gas going, sirens, cops are there, it's really dangerous, really crazy
16. And this one guy, he's getting arrested, okay
17. And as the cops are pulling him into the car, okay, he's screaming at the top of his lungs, call my girlfriend, call my girlfriend, and reciting her phone number to the crowd, okay
18. At that exact moment, a can of tear gas comes sailing through the air, hits me in the leg and I'm down on the ground, okay
19. And as my friends are dragging me to safety, the only thing I can think to myself is, oh, my God, you memorized her number
20. That's beautiful
21. Feels like I'm not asking for too much, you know what I mean
22. Yeah, yeah, it's tough being single
23. It feels like the guys that I'm trying to see, you know, they're not really trying to really get to know who I am, right
24. They don't really want to get to know the real me
25. I hooked up with this one guy, and he texted me afterwards
26. He said, you're the kinkiest girl I've ever been with
27. And I said, I know this text was not meant for me
28. And I knew that because at the time I had my arm in the sink and I was soaking off a Band-Aid, okay
29. Because I was too afraid to take it off because of the pain
30. So that just wasn't true
31. That just wasn't true
32. I've been trying to mix things up, been trying to change up my luck, you know, see if I can get some
33. And I asked a guy out recently, and I realized I sound a little needy
34. I sound a little desperate in a way I'm not super thrilled about
35. I sound like a white woman with a pyramid scheme
36. Um
37. sat the guy down, said, hey, Bessie, this will only take five minutes of your time
38. And ultimately, it is an opportunity for growth, right
39. We start now in six months, we're taking it far
40. But there are also part-time options, if that's better for you
41. The moral of the story is, ladies, you cannot girl boss your way into his heart, okay
42. It's tough to realize that
43. It's fucking tough
44. It was a holiday weekend the other weekend
45. I didn't go home
46. I usually don't go home for holidays because I kind of struggle with body image issues
47. And whenever I go home, they're always talking about how small my mom is and how much smaller she is than me
48. And it's not too bad
49. I mean, they're not wrong
50. She does look very skinny in her urn
51. She's about that big
52. Don't get much bigger than that
53. I see some concerned faces, but listen up, okay
54. Listen up
55. I'm giving you a great tip right now
56. Throw away those diet pills, okay
57. Throw away those shakes
58. Okay, I guess cremation burns fat
59. Anyway
60. Yeah, I do have some body image issues, and I always worried that it would come up in a relationship, right
61. But I can confidently tell you that I have never been broken up with for my body, okay
62. I have only been broken up with because of my personality
63. I've only been broken up with because of who I am
64. You know, when you get broken up with for your body, it's a little bit easier because you can always go out and get a revenge body, right
65. It's harder to get a revenge personality, isn't it
66. Isn't it
67. But I have been working on one
68. I've been working on a revenge personality and I wanted to show it to you guys and see what you think
69. Okay
70. My revenge personality, I'm thinking, is just gonna be a really cool British girl, okay
71. And this is how it is
72. Okay, so instead of, like, when my boyfriend's mean to me, instead of being like, I'm gonna kill myself, I'm gonna be like, hey, that really wasn't rock and roll, was it
73. Really not rock and roll at all
74. And then, you know, if we have sex for the first time, instead of being like, I'm going to marry you, I'm going to watch you die, I'm going to say, hey, that was pretty rock and roll, wasn't it
75. Pretty freaking rock and roll
76. Yeah, yeah
77. Um, I want to talk to you guys about something that's important to me
78. Okay, I want to talk about voting for a second
79. So, yeah, yeah
80. Guys, you know, we've got less than 100 days, okay, until the midterm elections, okay
81. It's quickly coming upon us, and I'm Gen Z, and Gen Z is kind of famously skeptical about voting, and I get it, because for a long time I was the same way
82. I kind of approached voting the same way that I approached Hinge and dating apps, right
83. Like ultimately just pick the dude you are least afraid to be in an elevator with and move on
84. You know what I mean
85. But I actually think that Gen Z can create more change than we might otherwise think
86. I was thinking about it the other day and I realized that Gen Z got rid of skinny jeans quicker than Abraham Lincoln got rid of slavery
87. You know what I mean
88. He kind of dragged his feet a little bit
89. Did he not
90. He did
91. He took his time
92. But Gen Z, when we see a problem, we immediately eliminate it, right
93. Like, it took probably a good couple hundred years to get rid of slavery
94. Took a couple hundred years for women, some women, to get the right to vote
95. Took hundreds of years for the U
96. S
97. to become an independent nation
98. Gen Z got rid of wearing bras
99. drinking regular milk and generally liking things between the release of the first Avatar movie and the trailer for the second
100. That is a very ambitious timeline, right
101. I can't remember the last time that I used capital letters and punctuation in a text message
102. Gen Z got rid of that
103. Because ultimately, at this point, it's like if you're still wearing bras, you need to grow up, right
104. And if you're using capital letters and punctuation, you need to calm down
