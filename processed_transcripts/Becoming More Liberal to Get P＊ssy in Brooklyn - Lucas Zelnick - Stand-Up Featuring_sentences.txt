1. It's good to be here
2. You guys well
3. I'm well
4. I was just in Europe
5. I always forget when I go to Europe that there's, like, a toxically bro-y patriotic guy that comes out of me there, you know
6. Because I was a bro-y guy for a long time, and then I became a lot more liberal to get pussy in Brooklyn, and
7. And because it was the right thing to do
8. In that order, unfortunately
9. But I always forget when I go to Europe, that side of me comes out, because I flew to France
10. I was running through the airport to make a connection
11. I'm running next to this French guy
12. We're both sweating, sprinting
13. We get to our connection and we miss it
14. And he turns to me and he goes, well, at least we both did sport
15. And somewhere deep within me, I was just like, fuck outta here with that gay shit, bro
16. There's one sport and it's American football
17. And we get concussions and we kill ourselves
18. I'm a liberal, I become a Republican in France
19. I think if they're so worried about us being snowflakes, they should send us to Paris for a week
20. It'll be like liberal birthright
21. Oh, you're inclusive of everyone
22. Try buying a croissant from a guy wearing jean shorts
23. One week in Paris and a non-binary person from Brooklyn will be like, my pronouns are fuck France
24. I don't give a shit
25. I don't like Europe because I'm a Jew
26. And that's the end of that sentence
27. I'm not a religious Jew
28. I feel like everyone has their different reasons for not being religious
29. Personally, I'm just not religious because I grew up rich
30. just never needed that excess hope
31. You guys are mad, but that's pretty funny
32. How are you gonna be a religious rich kid
33. My dad bought me an apartment, so I'd like to thank God
34. Thank God for private equity
35. There's a little piece of the Lord in every leveraged buyout
36. It is weird talking about, though, because I'll go up after, like, a black comedian, and after their shows, black people will come up to them and say, thank you so much for sharing your story on stage
37. That really meant something to me
38. And then I do my shows, and it's usually just three straight white guys that will come up to me, and they'll be like, yo, low-key, we're rich as well
39. I'm like, I'm not your champion, motherfucker
40. But my family, we have our shit, you know
41. My sister has special needs, which, that's kind of like our poor
42. My sister's special needs debts are your financial situation
43. It's hard to describe the nature of her disability
44. She was born neurotypical
45. She got sick
46. So the way that I describe it is she had this school project where she had to paint a picture and fill in a blank that said, America is blank
47. And she painted a picture of a meadow with a horse in it
48. And then she wrote, America is horses
49. And I love saying that to liberal people because you guys are like, and that's exactly right
50. America is plural horses
51. She didn't even draw two horses in the picture
52. If anything, it should have been America is horse
53. That's what I love about my sister
54. She's like a wild card
55. And I feel like you need a wild card on your team
56. Like we can all agree, if you ever go to a restaurant, you must be very polite to the wait staff
57. However, 50% of the way through every meal, my sister will look the waiter dead in the eyes and go, where's my food
58. So we walk into every restaurant knowing we are going to take an L by the time we leave
59. We walk into a restaurant the way that Kanye walks onto a podcast
60. Calm in the beginning, but he knows what he's gonna do in there
61. And the best part is I get to watch the waiter's eyes as they go through like 30 seconds of like this bitch to like, oh, she's got something going on for sure
62. Because my sister will be like, where's my food
63. And the waiter will be like, ma'am, you need to do whatever you want to do, girly
64. The best part is it does bring the food out faster
65. I think because the waiter goes back to the kitchen and they're like, look, table four is getting pretty exercised
66. It's to the point that if the food is taking too long, I'll give her a bit of a look
67. But it was weird growing up with a sibling with special needs
68. Especially when I was younger, I didn't know how to process it
69. Like when I was really young, when I was a kid, I thought she was faking it
70. I did, I thought
71. At the end of a long day, she got back to her room, closed the door, and was like, got him again
72. Five consecutive days of dessert for breakfast
73. This family is
74. Split decision on that one
75. Half of you guys were like, no, and a couple guys in the back were like, we back, baby
76. I don't think that's a good word
77. It's just, I don't think the phrase special needs is much better, you know
78. Like my sister doesn't have special needs
79. She has basic needs
80. She needs to be taken care of, shown love
81. I have special needs
82. I need to tell jokes on a stage every night to feel good about myself
83. We'll see if you're still clapping after this next part
84. I'm not against the word
85. I'm not against the word
86. I'm not for it, I should say
87. I wouldn't, like, march
88. Bring it back
89. Bring it back
90. It's just, you have to understand the words of the marginalized groups, they're relevant to the struggles those groups face
91. And my sister doesn't even know what that word means
92. So for her to be offended by it, I'd have to teach her what it means and then teach her she should be offended
93. You know what I'm saying
94. I'd have to be like, come in here, champ
95. You having a good day
96. Not for long, you're not
97. And she'd be like, what's that word
98. And I'd be like, I think it's when you say America is horses
