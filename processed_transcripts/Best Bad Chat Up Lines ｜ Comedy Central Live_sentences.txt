1. Are you a member of the Jacobs family
2. Because you're a right old cracker
3. Are you from Ireland
4. Because my penis is double
5. Hey, my mum would love you
6. Do you have Instagram
7. My mum always told me to follow my tweets
8. Is your name Durex
9. Because I've got a condom with your name on it
10. I know the alphabet
11. Hey, BC
12. Do you like raisins
13. How about dates
14. Did it hurt when you fell from heaven
15. E-S-G-H-I-J-K-L-M-F-O-P
16. Are you on Spotify
17. Because you're one of the hottest singles around
18. Hello
19. That's always a good start, to say hello
20. Hey, are you a full moon
21. Because you're making my emotions peak
22. Q-R-S-T-U-V-W
23. One that's popular in the valleys we're in from, which is wanna neck
24. Wanna neck
25. You have to say it with aggression
26. Wanna neck
27. Club was closing, the lights came on, and this guy came up to me and went, well, no one else wants us, should we just go
28. And I said, yes
29. Hey, dude, we're having a bottle lunch brunch, so would you want to be the first party
30. Do you like pizza
31. Because I want to pizza you, baby
32. XYZ
33. Hold on, wait
34. I missed the D
35. You can get that later
36. Oh my God, oh my God, you dropped something
37. It's my number
38. I was messaging a man on a dating app and he said I looked like King Joffrey if he was not older
39. My vagina is like Scotland
40. People only visit America
41. Where are you
42. Which I use on Grindr all the time
43. A pretty girl like you should be sitting here all alone looking so sad
44. I'd probably just be like, are you alright
45. And then panic and leave
46. Are you a parking ticket
47. Because you've got fine Britain all over you
48. I don't really chat people off because I don't have the confidence
49. So what I probably would do is I'd just stare at them just like this
50. Unfortunately, people don't really talk to me at the bar
51. Hello, my name is X
52. Would you like to be my wife
53. I don't really believe in chat-up lines
54. I think it's best to just be authentic and just completely lose your mind when you're in front of someone attractive and just say something really just bad and completely tank and chat some more
55. Come back to mine
56. Not too fast, so fast
57. Do you want a crisp
58. And I say yes
59. And then we'd get married and that'd be it
60. I get inboxes like, you're beautiful, can I come to your house
61. That's a chat up line
62. I'm not here to tell you that I like you because you already know that
63. I'm not here to tell you that I want you because you already know that
64. Let me tell you something you don't know
65. 079 834 962 148
66. Get your coat darling, you've pulled
67. Have you been to jail because you stole my heart
68. Just something like that
69. Sex thing now is just my partner sending me lots of links to one bed flats on Rightmove
70. Occasionally if I want to spice things up I'll send her back a two bed flat that I think we can afford if her grandad chokes it
71. And then they either come over and ask me to stop staring or I get kicked out
72. Me and my partner have been together since we were about 17
73. So my strategy is to meet them when they're seven
74. But crucially, you have to both be seven and then wait for about nine years before making do
75. The most effective chance at my nine hour is the one that my girlfriend used on me
76. She didn't ask me out
77. She just told me we were going out
78. I think we can both agree that we're going out now
79. And that's my best chat about it
