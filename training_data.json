      "Which is how you know you're fucking killing it",
      "And apparently I have clinical depression, which was news to me, because I always just thought I was chill, but",
      "turns out you can be medically chill",
      "Life-threateningly chill",
      "It's funny, too, my friend, he also has clinical depression, but the thing is, my friend's 6'5\", so it's not the same",
      "I don't want to be a bitch, but, like, fuck tall people, okay",
      "I'm 5'9\", dude",
      "I'm so jealous of tall people, it's just hard for me to care about their problems",

      "I'm like, yeah, bro, just step over them",
      "What are you talking about",
      "But I was talking to my therapist, and I was like, what's, like, an actionable way for me to feel better about myself",
      "And she's like, go out and help somebody else in your life",
      "And I'm like, that's some Facebook-level advice, but OK",
      "And I was talking to my grandma",
      "My grandma, she's 93 years old",
      "And yeah, she's killing it",
      "Great woman",
      "And she's a widow",
      "Grandpa passed away a few years ago",
      "But recently, on one of our calls, she told me that she's back out here on the dating scene, 93",
      "Yeah",

      "You should definitely wear condoms",
      "She's riddled with STDs",
      "Look, it's called living a life",
      "No, but I was talking to her, and she said she's nervous of getting back out there on the apps, mostly because I don't think Tinder goes that high",
      "But I was like, yo, I'm a fuckboy piece of shit, you know",
      "Like, I can lend you my services, and she accepted, so now I'm out here trying to get my grandma some dick",
      "And the second weirdest part about that is that I had to have a conversation with her about what she's looking for in a man, which I never thought I'd have to do",
      "And she told me she's only looking for two things",
      "One, they have to be rich",
      "And I'm like, girl, fair",
      "Honestly, like, you're 93",
      "This is the closest to reparations you are ever gonna get",
      "Also, that's my inheritance",
      "Now this is a business decision for me",
      "\" And then she said, too, that she's not looking for anything long-term",
      "I'm like, bitch, you are 93",
      "How much confidence do you have",
      "Our conversations are long-term",
      "So it turns out my grandma's also a fuckboy, just runs in our family like depression",
      "But I did it",
      "I set up a profile, which is just black and white pics she gave me from the 50s",
      "We're out here catfishing senior citizens as a family",
      "And I'm swiping",
      "I land on this guy Alan's profile, and Alan's cool, dude",
      "Like, we vibe",
      "I tell him all the movies I like",
      "He tells me all the injections he needs to make it through the week, you know",
      "Cute first day stuff",
      "And eventually I ask him out",
      "He says, yeah",
      "And he and my grandma, they've been going out for like a few months now",
      "Nah, fuck her",
      "Because Alan's my man, okay",
      "She didn't earn that",
      "She doesn't know Alan like I do",
      "So she's out there with the love of my life, and I'm with you fucking people",
      "But you guys have been great",

      "Don't laugh at the troll, troll me the troll",
      "Oh, my God",
      "So proud of it",
      "Now, if you're a young couple doing this for the first time, this snack thing, and you have kids in any sport, you want to go with the beginning of the season when expectations are low",

      "Then by the end of the season, you're forced to bring pizza, a DJ, and a stripper",
      "And everybody's still complaining",
      "They're like, are these songs fast to you",
      "She seems older",
      "So he's made a snack list",
      "He's also the worst coach ever, but you can't do anything about it",

      "Leaving all the parents on the sideline going, did he just fall asleep",
      "Because I have a hard enough time getting that guy to sleep as it is",
      "I don't need Coach Rascal giving him cholo night terrors",

      "You should know it",
      "A hand squeeze with a squint and a head nod, which means, get in there, asshole, and say something",
      "Time for you to man up, or I'm gonna say something",
      "And there's a counter move to that",
      "I squeezed her hand even a little bit harder, looked her in the eyes and said, we're not saying shit",
      "You let Coach Rascal conduct his business, so we're gonna find out why the rabbit's crying, and I don't wanna find out",

      "And I'm like, no, all of it",
      "And like, I was sitting in a car and Coldplay came on and the driver of the car went, oh, Coldplay",
      "And I had to be like, yeah, I hate music",

      "And I said, what",
      "And I swear to God, he went, okay",
      "And I said, why should I feel guilty",
      "Huh",

      "And I said, why should I feel guilty for seeing a once in a generation talent sing timeless classics",
      "And he didn't respond",
      "And then I said something that I'm genuinely sure is the most embarrassing thing I've ever said",
      "I crossed my arms",

      "Hold on, hold on, it's way worse than you think",
      "she had a tattoo on her lower back of the Twin Towers and the words, never forget",
      "First of all, boner killer",
      "Second of all, that means that at some point in her life, she walked into a tattoo, presumably after 9-11, otherwise it's crazy",
      "She walked into a tattoo parlor and was like, I want a permanent reminder of the saddest day in American history",
      "And they were like, Gettysburg",
      "And she's like, statistic, no",
      "More recent",
      "And they're like, 9-11",
      "All right, where do you want it",
      "And she's like, it should be a reminder",
      "And they're like, yeah",
      "She's like, you remind me every day",
      "And they're like, yeah",
      "Where do you want it",
      "And she's like, well, what's the one part of my body I could never see ever unless I had a neck like an owl",
      "But here's why it's really horrifying slash great",
      "Because time isn't always kind to people's bodies",
      "And eventually, her skin is gonna sag",
      "And those Twin Towers are gonna collapse again",
      "So it's less of a reminder and more of a reenactment"

      "Incredible, what's that",
      "Are either of us from, have any personal connection to or ever been to Slough",
      "No, absolutely not",

      "That's all I've got for you, right",
      "And I've been there",
      "Right, so we eventually get there",
      "By the way, we were evening invite only",

      "That's what I'm trying to say",

      "No, what I mean is I come from quite a working class background, right",
      "All my family, I was the first person in my family to leave my hometown and go to university and waste £30,000 and do nothing, okay",
      "Came back and moved to London and now, ostensibly, I live quite a middle class life, okay",
      "Like I live in East London, I work in the arts, I've got a nose ring, I'm a twat, essentially",
      "That's what I'm trying to say, okay",
      "But I've got a middle-class brain now",

      "Who thinks that Just Stop Oil are an indie band from 2009",

      "And I'm like, why, Quan",
      "That sounds awesome, you know",
      "And she's like, well, I'm offended because I'm Asian",
      "And I was just like, well, I'm sorry, but I didn't even notice that",
      "I didn't",
      "I thought you were just like really tired",

      "There was this little old woman sitting next to me",
      "You know when they get, like, really little and old",
      "Like, she looked like a raisin",
      "I was like, I want to put you in my cereal",
      "But anyway, this woman on the subway",
      "Guys, when I say she was old, like, she was in Downward Dog",
      "I was like, why is your body asking a question",
      "But, um",
      "So out of nowhere, she asked me, she was like, have you heard the good news",
      "And I didn't know what she meant",
      "I was just like, no",
      "Like, is the morning after pill over the counter again",
      "Like, what's",
      "For some of us, it's plan A, so",
      "I was excited",
      "But I'm just like, what's the good news",

      "And I was like, no",
      "We found him",
      "Maybe you even heard the bad news",
      "I",
      "So hard",
      "Thank you",
      "Thank you",
      "She died in my arms, but, um",
      "Really sad, but",
      "I watch a lot of reality TV",
      "I'll be honest with you guys",
      "And I was actually on two reality shows, which is crazy, you know, just to think that out there there was some guy, like, flipping through the channels, being like, hey, I 69ed her on a cruise ship",
      "It's",
      "No, he's not here",
      "I'm always looking, but, uh",
      "I miss out on so many great reality shows, because the title throws me off",
      "My friends all got really into that show, The Deadliest Catch",
      "But I never watched it, because I always just assumed it was about AIDS",
      "It's about crabs",
      "Don't tune in looking for that big AIDS hour",
      "No, some people know nothing about that disease",
      "It's really sad",
      "Like, my college roommate, Lisa, oh, my God",
      "I remember we were freshmen",
      "I was like, hey, Lisa, like, you should go get tested, because you're a huge slut",
      "You let your friends know, right",
      "Not like I was awesome",
      "I mean, I thought the freshman 15 was how many guys you were supposed to sleep with, but gained it",
      "But I should have known that Lisa was a slut, because the day she moved in, she showed me",
      "She was one of those girls who could put her whole fist in her",
      "Yeah",
      "I'm like, let me hang up my Dave Matthews poster first, please",
      "Got these ramen noodles brewing",
      "I can't even believe I graduated from college",
      "I feel like you know what you're gonna be good at when you're older, based on what you like when you're younger",
      "Like, when I was younger, my best friend was Tony, this kid Tony, and he loved rocks",
      "He was always, like, playing with rocks, counting them, and now he's a crackhead, so",
      "It's amazing, isn't it",
      "It's really amazing",
      "But the best example is my older brother, because when we were kids, he loved cats",
      "Everybody else likes dogs, right",
      "No, loved cats",
      "And he grew up to be this huge pussy, so",
      "It's weird how it worked out that way, isn't it",
      "I just, I lost some weight this year thanks to Spanx",
      "So yeah, our little secret",
      "But there's so much pressure for women to be skinny, right",
      "We turn on the TV and who do we see",
      "We see like the girls from the hills, right",
      "Trying to form thoughts",
      "That's how they burn their calories",
      "Little Heidi's head's gonna explode",
      "Or we see Paris Hilton with the Chihuahua",
      "What's its name",
      "Nicole Richie",
      "It's hard",
      "It's hard",
      "And the way that these girls keep themselves skinny is awful, isn't it",
      "By vomiting or using hard drugs, which I can't afford, so",
      "It's hard",
      "Um, but, no, usually I feel pretty good about myself",
      "Like, I know what I look like",
      "Like, you'd bang me, but you wouldn't blog about it",
      "I get it",
      "I'm fine with it",
      "You won't be twittering, like, you won't believe who I'm inside, but it's fine",
      "I'm okay",
      "I'm fine",
      "But it's hard, because I just went through a breakup, actually",
      "And I'm not worried about meeting someone else or being lonely",
      "I'm just, like, worried about all the pictures",
      "But",
      "But my mom always told me, you know, ever since I was a little girl, you know, never put your face in them, so",
      "That always splits the audience",
      "I find out where the slutty's are",
      "There's one",
      "Good job",
      "Oh, God",
      "But my mom's always saying really smart things like that",
      "Like, you probably heard this one",
      "Why buy the cow when the milk has HPV",
      "Yeah",
      "Wish I'd listened to that one, but here we are",
      "I want to be one less, but I'm not",
      "Thanks for nothing, Gardasil",
      "Ding",
      "Do you know what HPV is",
      "You will",
      "It's this fun party disease, guys",
      "People are like, who brought the HPV",
      "I'm like, this girl",
      "Every couple months, one of my girlfriends will call me, crying her eyes out, without fail, crying",
      "Aimee, I just found out I have HPV",
      "I feel like such a whore",
      "I'm like, what about you sleeping with the swim team in college",
      "Like, that didn't ring the whore bell",
      "But now you know",
      "You don't know what you can catch out there",
      "Let me say something normal and not horrible",
      "I hate false advertising, okay",
      "I do",
      "Like, Skittles, taste the rainbow, right",
      "No one's ever been like, rainbow, right, you guys",
      "Or what's Reese's",
      "Oh, there's no wrong way to eat a Reese's",
      "Really",
      "Like, tell that to my uncle",
      "He used to put them in my underwear, right",
      "Right",
      "All right, maybe your uncles didn't love you",
      "Think about it",
      "No, I'm sorry",
      "That's an inside joke",
      "Hey, you guys",
      "Who's on Facebook",
      "I am",
      "Some of you, yeah",
      "It's crazy, right",
      "It's weird",
      "Do you guys remember the thing before MySpace, before Facebook",
      "Destiny",
      "Remember Destiny, where when you were supposed to run into someone from the past, that's when it happened",
      "Now every idiot from high school's like, I'm back",
      "We weren't supposed to meet again",
      "Stop poking me and inviting me to your weird vampire parties, okay",
      "No, I don't want to follow you on Twitter",
      "Like, nobody's interested in you",
      "I don't want to see you in real life",
      "Why would I want to follow you in the imaginary one",
      "But gosh, Facebook is weird",
      "Anybody can get in touch with you",
      "Total strangers write to me",
      "A stranger wrote to me last week",
      "He's like, hey, Amy, I just pleasured myself looking at a picture of you on Facebook",
      "There he is",
      "He's not bad",
      "He's not bad",
      "Good job",
      "Could have been worse",
      "No, but, you know, just, like, one picture",
      "And I just think that's gross, you know",
      "But I was just like, well, which one",
      "I should probably make it my profile picture",
      "What",
      "It's weird out there",
      "It's hard dating",
      "And I really did just have my heart broken",
      "And what do your friends do when you have your heart broken",
      "They take you out and get you drunk",
      "Right",
      "And isn't that the worst idea in the world",
      "You get drunk and lonely and make out with a PA that goes tanning from Babylon",
      "And you're like, why",
      "I should have just stayed home, watched Law and Order, the one with the sexually based offenses we all like",
      "Oh, man",
      "But the guy I was seeing, he was a very cool Catholic guy",
      "So he would feel really guilty right after sex",
      "So I would pretend like I felt guilty, too",
      "I'd be like, oh, I feel really bad",
      "Maybe you should go home",
      "Because I swear, I found the one guy in Manhattan that loves, like, spooning",
      "You know, just hugging all night",
      "And I like sleeping by myself, like a swastika",
      "I'm just like",
      "He's all up on this",
      "I can do urban shows, too",
      "He's good",
      "Very neat for a boy, you know",

      "Oh, my God",
      "That thing never shut up",
      "But the bird was cool",
      "My ex-girlfriend had a lot of, like, really annoying habits",
      "You know, I think the worst was she loved to read women's magazines, you know, like Cosmo or things like Cosmo",
      "And she would flip straight to the relationship quiz",
      "And not only would she present that to me as if it was like a fun activity for us to do together, even though every question is designed to my entire world up",
      "But even worse is she would get mad at my answers and make me change them so we'd get the best score",
      "Like, I'll never forget the last time we played that game",
      "She was like, Anthony, if you could have lunch with anyone in the world, living or dead, who would it be",
      "And I said, I don't know",
      "Caligula",
      "And she goes, really",
      "Caligula",
      "That's your answer",
      "That's what you're going to say to me, your girlfriend",
      "Are you sure",
      "I said, oh, I'm sorry, baby",
      "Let me change that",
      "I'd have lunch with you",
      "And you'd be dead",
      "Yeah, we're not together anymore",
      "She's got a new boyfriend now",
      "They just moved in together",
      "And I've heard rumors that he's abusive, which makes you want to go over there with a baseball bat",
      "and then blame it on her boyfriend",
      "But I don't want to sound like a misogynist up here",
      "My ex-girlfriend wasn't like a bad person, really",
      "She wasn't a bad girl at all",
      "But she was terrible in bed",
      "Terrible in bed",
      "I mean, she would just lie there, screaming, no",
      "That was rape joke number two, baby doll",
      "Yeah, clap it up",
      "But my girlfriend now is great",
      "My girlfriend now is almost perfect",
      "And she hates that I tell rape jokes",
      "Hates it",
      "Says, Anthony, how could you make light of something as terrible as rape after I told you that I got raped in high school",
      "And I said, baby, because I don't believe you",
      "My girlfriend and I argue a lot",
      "It's mostly her arguing with me kind of thing",
      "Like, I should just keep my mouth shut",
      "Every fight we get into is my fault",
      "I should just keep my mouth shut, but I can't because I'm so funny",
      "Like, a couple of nights ago, we go to a party",
      "We get trashed, completely wasted",
      "We wake up in bed the next morning completely hungover",
      "And I know I should just keep my mouth shut",
      "But instead, I roll over and I say, listen, baby, don't get mad, but I think your mom tried to have sex with me last night",
      "And she hit the roof",
      "She goes, Anthony, that's impossible",
      "And I said, oh, well, in that case, you should always wear makeup",
      "I love that joke so much",
      "Here's why",
      "Did you guys hear, like, the sounds you made",
      "Like, that was the worst thing I've said tonight",
      "I've told three rape jokes",
      "I like to play pranks on my girlfriend, you know, keep things fresh for me, make me laugh",
      "You know, she hates it",
      "But like the other night, I put saran wrap over the toilet seat",
      "Which doesn't sound that original",
      "But she's bulimic",
      "I like that you laugh until I look at you and then you stop laughing",
      "Because you don't want to give me the satisfaction",
      "It's great, you seem like a cool girl in a completely different environment",
      "But we make it work, you know",
      "Like, how long have you guys been together right here",
      "Three years, okay",
      "What would you say is like the secret to like a good long relationship",
      "Communication, wrong",
      "The secret is trying new things together, especially in the bedroom",
      "The other night, my girlfriend and I are in bed together",
      "She says, Anthony, I want you to pee on me",
      "No, I have never thought about peeing on a woman in my entire life",
      "Never even imagined it before",
      "But then I got the green light",
      "and apparently it's my thing",
      "Like I just jumped up right away",
      "But as soon as that begins, she starts screaming at me",
      "Like it's my fault she talks in her sleep",
      "No big deal for me",
      "My girlfriend yells at me all the time",
      "She yells at me all the time",
      "And again, I'm a gentleman",
      "I never think it's okay to yell back at a woman no matter what",
      "I mean, you saw how I handled that , right",
      "I never think it's okay to yell back at a woman",
      "But the other night, she yelled at me for so long and so loud that the cops came to the door, which is embarrassing because now I've got to answer my own door and say, officers, I'm so sorry",
      "There is no reason for you to be here tonight",
      "I already tased her",
      "I've got this friend named Kevin",
      "I call him a friend",
      "More of an acquaintance, really",
      "One of those people who think they're way better friends with you than they actually are",
      "Like the other day, Kevin says to me, hey man, you know what I like to do when I'm all by myself and no one's around",
      "And before I can say hey, we're not really friends",
      "He says, I like to take peanut butter and smear it all over myself and then let my dog lick it off",
      "I said, dude, you have got to get yourself a girlfriend",
      "I'll trade you mine for that dog",
      "Being a comedian is the greatest job in the world",
      "Like, greatest job in the world once you get to my level",
      "The only thing I don't like is all the travel",
      "I'm always flying somewhere, always in an airport",
      "Even flying into Chicago a couple days ago",
      "Two and a half hour flight delay",
      "I'm stuck in an airport bar talking to some random ass",
      "And I got nowhere to go",
      "So I'm like, hey man, what do you do",
      "And he says, and I quote, oh, nothing right now, but I used to be a priest",
      "As in, oh, , right",
      "But I got nowhere to go",
      "So we keep talking, we keep drinking",
      "Finally, two hours goes by",
      "Guy gets up, he says, hey man, I gotta catch my flight",
      "But I don't wanna lie to you",
      "I used to be a priest, I got kicked out, because I molested a kid",
      "Now here's the thing",
      "After talking to this guy, and getting to know this guy for two hours, I have to admit, he was actually a really cool guy",
      "If you could forget about, you know",
      "All that Jesus bull",
      "Yeah, that's a favorite",
      "I'm probably gonna tell it again later",
      "But it's not all bad news with me",
      "My grandfather turns 100 years old next month",
      "Maybe",
      "I'm really skeptical",
      "I don't think I ever got over my grandmother's death when I was a kid",
      "My grandmother died from a heart attack during my ninth birthday party",
      "Literally while she was eating cake",
      "And I guess that must have screwed me up a little bit",
      "I mean, I still have birthday parties",
      "But now I'm just careful what I wish for",
      "I'm sure my dad had his problems",
      "He had his issues",
      "My dad was a big time alcoholic",
      "Major league alcoholic",
      "Blackout every night kind of alcoholic",
      "But to his credit, my dad never once laid a finger on either me or my mom",
      "Not once",
      "And I don't know if it was just because he loved us so much or if he just hated my sisters",
      "But either way, Either way, he was a great dad",
      "I remember a tough time for me",
      "I was like 10 years old",
      "My parents called me into their bedroom",
      "They say, Anthony, we want to get a divorce",
      "You have to decide which one of us you want to live with",
      "And I was a 10-year-old kid",
      "I didn't know any better",
      "I just said, dad, dad, I want to live with dad",
      "It was heartbreaking",
      "My mom just looked at the floor and said, well, whatever you want, Anthony",
      "And my dad just said, I don't want a divorce anymore",
      "And maybe the most uncomfortable moment of my life was when my dad gave me the sex talk",
      "God, the old man was into some really crazy",
      "But then maybe the greatest moment of my life ever, I think this is like a universal thing for guys, I'm 12 years old, I'm sneaking around my house, and I found my dad's porn in the back of the attic",
      "That was a great day",
      "That was a game changer for me",
      "But then the worst day of my life was the day I found my mom's porn in the back of that video store",
      "I told that joke recently on Conan",
      "That's right, Conan",
      "And immediately afterwards, my mom called me on the phone",
      "And she said, Anthony, what the",
      "Do you really have to make up a joke that makes me sound like I work in pornography and then say it on Conan",
      "That's my least favorite joke that you have",
      "And I just said, well, mom, that's only because you haven't heard the other jokes I tell about you",
      "That they are not allowed to let me say I'm Conan",
      "Per example",
      "My mom is crazy",
      "People always like to joke, oh, my mom's crazy",
      "My mom is crazy",
      "Her entire house is filled with nothing but pictures of Princess Diana",
      "And they're all from right after the accident",
      "Most of them she drew",
      "Like, it's really up, you guys",
      "And my mom's been having a hard time lately",
      "She just found out she has to have both of her breasts removed if she's ever gonna be good at golf",
      "Yeah, that can not be easy to hear",
      "So I went home to visit",
      "I'm from Pittsburgh originally",
      "Just hang out with my mom for a little bit, you know",
      "Yeah, congrats",
      "I want to go home and hang out with her for a little bit, you know, help her out, cheer her up",
      "But all my mom cares about now is the lottery and me running errands for her, like, every day",
      "Every day, it's, Anthony, go play my numbers",
      "Go play my numbers, please",
      "I don't want to miss out today",
      "Finally, after a week of this, I had to say to her, Mom, are you out of your goddamn mind",
      "Don't you know you've got a better chance of getting struck by lightning than me doing you a favor",
      "I know you guys have been a great crowd tonight",
      "You've gone with me everywhere I've wanted you to go",
      "But you've just been sitting there this whole time thinking, Anthony, this is all well and good",
      "But where are your offensive jokes",
      "Where are your showstoppers, if you will",
      "Well, guys, I saved those for the end",
      "I'm going to tell you all a series of jokes right now",
      "that are going to get increasingly more offensive",
      "I like that enthusiasm",
      "Let's see how far it carries",
      "They say it's easy",
      "They say it's easy to make fun of retarded people",
      "But let me tell you guys something, it is not",
      "You have really got to explain it to them",
      "That was the first one",
      "Every night my girlfriend comes home from work and she brings with her a houseplant",
      "She's like, Anthony, I had to pick this up",
      "We need a houseplant in our apartment",
      "And every night I make her return it",
      "I say, no way, baby",
      "You can't take care of a houseplant",
      "You couldn't even keep your baby alive",
      "Two for two, huh",
      "We just found out my little brother has a peanut allergy",
      "A peanut allergy, which is very serious, I know",
      "But still, I feel like my parents are totally overreacting",
      "They caught me eating a tiny little bag of airline peanuts, and they kicked me out of his funeral",
      "I feel like some of you guys might be too nice to laugh at some of these jokes",
      "And that's OK",
      "Not everybody has a great sense of humor",
      "You guys would probably love my little nephew",
      "He's like six years old",
      "So cute",
      "I talk to him every day on the phone",
      "And he's unbelievable",
      "He's got like the greatest imagination ever",
      "He's either going to be an incredible artist someday, or he really did get molested",
      "I wasn't even laughing about that one",
      "I was thinking about what's coming",
      "I feel like I need to say, like, I really believe this, that being a mother seems like one of the toughest jobs in the world",
      "Like, literally, right below comedian",
      "So to me, if a mother does her best, then in my book, she's a good mom",
      "Now, my mom did her very best",
      "Unfortunately, she was also a terrible person",
      "Like my mom for most of her life, and this is true, my mom for most of her life was a Holocaust denier",
      "Does everybody know what that means",
      "I mean, she couldn't believe the Holocaust happened",
      "It's like the worst thing you can be",
      "And it was terrible for the entire family to have to deal with",
      "Until finally, a couple years ago, we had an intervention",
      "And we had a rabbi come into the home, had him walk her through the history of the Jewish people",
      "And then he made her watch Schindler's List",
      "And after that, my mom did a complete 180",
      "Now",
      "she can't believe it only happened once",
      "I'm not a religious person",
      "I would call myself an atheist",
      "I don't have a good story behind it",
      "I'm just reasonable",
      "My girlfriend has got the greatest story behind why she's not religious anymore",
      "She said when she was a kid, like 12 years old, her parents nailed a 25-pound crucifix to the wall right above her bed",
      "And about two weeks later, in the middle of the night, the crucifix falls off the wall and leaves a two-inch gash in the back of her dad's head",
      "Like, whether you laughed or not, you gotta admit, that's a great story",
      "Now, this is the ideal time to tell you guys that I love to meet fans after the show",
      "I like when people come up and say, Anthony, you're a genius",
      "Anthony, best show I've ever seen",
      "And that's it",
      "I don't ever want to hear anything else",
      "If you've got a bone to pick with me over something I've said tonight, instead, you should just shut the up",
      "Because seriously, I know more about comedy than you do",
      "And you came to see me",
      "Like I said, shut the up",
      "But still, even after I've just said all that, you still feel like you need to come up and bitch",
      "Well, then I will be as polite as I can possibly be",
      "However, it is ill-advised",
      "because you will end up as a joke in my act",
      "Much like the blind guy who came up and complained to me in Seattle after a show",
      "He walked up and said, Anthony, Anthony",
      "Why didn't you tell any blind jokes tonight",
      "I came here to hear blind jokes tonight",
      "And I said, well, Here's a blind joke",
      "Another good one for me was the lesbian in Portland who ran up after a show",
      "And I know she was a lesbian because she ran up and yelled out, Anthony, I'm a lesbian",
      "And I thought you were really funny tonight, but you're just lucky you didn't make any lesbian jokes up there, because I would have gotten really mad if you had made fun of any lesbians tonight",
      "And I wanted to say to her, hey, do you realize that that makes you a terrible person and that you have no sense of humor",
      "Plus, you're an idiot",
      "If you felt OK laughing at all the other messed up things I joked about, well, you'd have gotten really upset if I made fun of you or something you cared about",
      "And I was gonna say all that",
      "But then I remembered, Anthony, she's a lesbian",
      "She knows",
      "My second favorite post-show interaction of all time had to be, I was in Boston a couple years ago, and a very drunk girl, they're always very drunk, ran up to me",
      "And she screams out, you should never make fun of the Holocaust",
      "And I said, why",
      "You know, just to be a dick",
      "And she says, because I lost family in the Holocaust",
      "And I said, well, you don't look Jewish",
      "And she said, listen ass",
      "There are certain lines you're not supposed to cross, certain boundaries you're never supposed to push",
      "And I said, hey, hey, hey, I just gave you a compliment",
      "But my favorite, the best, most unbeatable, never going to happen again, post-show interaction of all time, had to be just about a year ago",
      "I was performing in Orlando, Florida, home of Casey Anthony",
      "And this is right after the trial, like immediately after the trial",
      "And I said, listen, everybody, I don't understand what the big deal is here",
      "Of course, Casey Anthony is innocent",
      "If she's guilty of anything, it's killing her baby",
      "Now, after the show, I'm taking pictures, signing tits",
      "You know how it is",
      "And a guy walks up to me",
      "totally sober, looking very upset",
      "And he says, you need to do me a favor, which is a terrible way to start",
      "He says, you need to never tell another Casey Anthony joke ever again",
      "And I said, why",
      "You know, just to be a dick",
      "And he says, I'll never forget this",
      "He says, because her daughter, Kaylee Anthony, is my niece",
      "And I said, bull",
      "At which point he takes out his phone, sadly hits a couple buttons, and he shows me a picture of him holding little Kaylee Anthony in happier times, of course",
      "And he says, see",
      "See, you son of a bitch",
      "And I said, no, man, I believe you",
      "I just mean she was your niece",
      "Thank you very much, everybody",
      "Have a great night",
      "Thank you so much",
      "All right, you guys, put your hands together",
      "Please welcome Anthony Desolete"

      "My friends have told me, though, that I should use exposure therapy to get over misophonia",
      "They think that if I'm exposed to the sounds that I don't like, I'll stop being annoyed by them",
      "But I know exposure therapy doesn't work for me because I've been exposed to things that I don't like in the past, and it backfired horribly",
      "Like, I'm not joking, and I don't know why, but I'm serious when I tell you that my biggest fear on Earth is conjoined twins",
      "The connected people, they scared the shit out of me",
      "About 10 years ago, I was in line at a fast food restaurant, thought I saw conjoined twins walking in, passed out cold on the spot",
      "Turns out it was just two young girls sharing a coat, but I saw two heads in one coat and passed out",
      "When I woke up and saw they were two separate human beings, I finally calmed down until I heard how loud they were eating their food",
      "I've talked about this on certain shows though and after some shows I've occasionally had people actually come up and point out to me that in certain Asian cultures you're encouraged to chew with your mouth open because it's seen as a sign of respect to the chef letting them know that you appreciate the flavor of the food so you eat loudly to let them know that and I want to be culturally sensitive so that's why to avoid losing my temper in public whenever I see someone chewing with their mouth open I just pretend they're Asian",
      "no matter what",
      "See a white dude chewing his mouth wide open",
      "I'm just like, that albino Korean respects this chef",
      "I can feel you guys tightening up on me",
      "And it's okay",
      "It doesn't bother me",
      "I'm used to this, because any time you do racial material in America, people get sensitive, because racial tensions are high in America",
      "And I do think a lot of the reason there is so much racial tension in America is because most Americans don't interact with people different than themselves",
      "Like, not everyone lives in a diverse city",
      "Most Americans live in really small, homogenous populations",
      "And you can tell they don't have to interact with people different than themselves",
      "And I do think that contributes to a lot of the racial tension that we see",
      "And I mean this from the bottom of my heart when I say I think you should never hate someone based on their race",
      "That's truly what I think",
      "I think you should never hate someone based on their race",
      "However, I do think you should hate at least one person from every race",
      "Because if you don't hate at least one person from a particular race, you obviously just don't know enough people from that race",
      "Like, every group of people has some bad apples",
      "If you can't think of at least one that you don't like, that just speaks to a lack of exposure",
      "Which means that your overly loving opinion is still coming from a place of ignorance",
      "So in a very weird way, if you don't hate at least one person from every race, you're kind of racist",
      "That joke didn't do well, and I will refuse to have them remove it from my set because I'm not, I don't give a fuck",
      "I'm not wrong",
      "This just 90% white crowd in Brooklyn was not prepared for the mirror that I just held up to you motherfuckers",
      "Don't clap now",
      "You had your opportunity to like the joke",
      "Fuck off",
      "We are not on the same team anymore, but I don't care",
      "I'll finish this goddamn set",
      "Race issues, class issues as well",
      "May as well go in now",
      "No, I feel like over the last few years in America, we've also decided across the board that we hate rich kids, which feels weird to me",
      "Like if they're assholes about it, yeah",
      "If they're the type of rich kid that'll like challenge you to a ski race for the rights of their father's mountain, then that's a hateable rich kid for sure",
      "But if they're otherwise really nice, hardworking individuals who just happen to have wealthy parents, then what did they do wrong",
      "You know",
      "We hate rich kids, but we don't hate lottery winners",
      "And in both cases, it just comes down to being lucky",
      "It's like, why is it okay to be lucky in a 7-Eleven and not in your father's ball sack",
      "No, but there are a lot of class issues",
      "They are legitimate, and I am sensitive to them",
      "A lot of jobs don't get paid what they deserve, and that's problematic",
      "The number one job that people cite is teachers",
      "Obviously, teachers deserve way more",
      "The problem is when people are arguing on behalf of teachers getting paid more, they always use the wrong example",
      "The most common cliche we hear is, it's a shame how much athletes make versus how much teachers make",
      "We've all heard that, right",
      "I used to be a teacher",
      "I'll be the first person to tell you teachers deserve way more money, no doubt about it, but it has nothing to do with how much athletes get paid",
      "Those are two completely separate arguments",
      "The fact is, for the most part, in America, people get paid according to the scarcity of their skill set",
      "And there simply are way more people mentally capable of teaching children how to read than there are people physically capable of dunking a basketball",
      "So if we want to narrow the wage gap, we don't need to raise teachers' pay, we need to lower the rims",
      "Just saying, make the hoop eight feet tall",
      "LeBron's making 60 grand next year"
