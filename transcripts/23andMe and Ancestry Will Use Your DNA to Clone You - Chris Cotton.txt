 Like, I'm from South Philly. Uh, I'm from South Philly. You know what I hate? I hate the fact that when I say that now, no one gives a shit anymore. Back in the day, you say you from South Philly, people would be like, oh, he's from South Philly, Hajiwala. Hajiwala. This guy's dangerous. Now you say it, it's like, oh, oh, South Philly's a nice place. On the gentrification, due to gentrification, it's nice now. And some of y'all are like, oh, he's about to complain about people moving it. I'm not. I don't care that much. My dad owns this house. So I don't care. Uh...  That sounds so selfish, but it's the truth. All right, now, the thing is, with justification, I'm not angry at people moving in. I'm angry that it's going to ruin the stories for my kids. Like, I don't want to be talking to my kids, be walking down the street, and I'm like, yo, see that house right there? Crack all day. That's where they sell crack at. Next to the muffin stand? It wasn't a muffin stand! It was crack. They give me two chocolate chip muffins. These kids got to learn.  Thing is, a lot of people say in the hood, well, people say that you gotta vote so you can change everything in the hood, make it better. It's dumb, you know what I mean? No president should be tweeting. None. But his tweets. He tweets at North Korea like he been beefing with them for like five years and they live around the corner. Those same tweets, if you work at Applebee's, you're like, I'm gonna leave this one in the drafts. Like, that might lose my job, you know what I mean? He's like, no, fuck that, I'm the president.  He sends out tweets. North Korea, if I see you, I'm going to slap the shit out you. Swear to God, hashtag free smoke. You're the president. You can't use free smoke. You can't use it. I'm not going to be surprised tonight if we go to bed and wake up and just eat a dick. That's what he tweets. That's the whole tweet. No context. It's everybody.  The president doesn't give a fuck, dude. It's awful. I see, okay, let's just say, you become a great-grandparent, right? One day, you're with your grandchild. You're helping them with their homework, their history homework. You get to number three, and number three reads, what was the tweet that started the war? And who was the president that tweeted? You're gonna be like, eh, that guy made some good points that last time.  It's just what it is, man. You know what's funny? Like, I look at this day and age now, and everybody's, like, running around, getting your 23andMe done. You know what I mean? Your DNA test. If you don't know what that is, they send you a DNA test. You send your DNA back, and you just trust it. That's it. You just trust it. They send you back a piece of paper. That's what you do. You give them your DNA. They give you back some paper. I mean, you still hide your Social Security number, because that's important to you. Sometimes when you're social, you get real quiet.  Bunch of DNA. I'll send it to some random dude I never met. That makes fucking sense. I'm sorry. Maybe it's because I grew up poor. I just don't trust that shit. No, hell no. I'm not sending my DNA to some random person. Oh, it's a 23 in me. People get all excited. They get their little paperback. You know what I mean? They start crying. Oh, I thought I was all Scottish.  Come to find out I'm half Jamaican. No, the fuck you're not. You're not half Jamaican. Whoever stood it off the pages, they just letting them shit, they just making them rain. They don't give a fuck what envelope they going in. Think they really care? They just got a job. I just got hired, fuck them. He's Jamaican, you know what I mean? White dudes in Brooklyn just saying, hey, wagwan, what the fuck is wrong with you, Jeff? What are you doing? Get off the back of your leg before you get the shits left on you.  Nah, brethren, check out the paperwork. You know what's funny? If the ancestry people, when the 23andMe people get together, they are cloning all you motherfuckers. When I say that joke, people get a little tight. They're like, oh, man, fuck, he got a good point. I did register for both of those.  I'm fucked. And some people are like, he's just being dramatic. You say that until you end up at one of those big box buildings or a convenience store, and you're serving you. You go, oh, this is weird. Hi, me. Yeah, motherfucker. Yeah, they cloned the shit out of you. You did the hand surgery, didn't you? Yep, they got me good. All 23andMe is is like Carfax with DNA. It just shows you all this shit that could be, you know what I mean? And if you had a previous owner, that's for black people. That's that.
