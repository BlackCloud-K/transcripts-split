 Hi, my name is Moe. I'm from Wales. This is what we look like now. It's global warming. We've had to adapt. I'm from Cardiff. And basically, it's a nice place. It's the capital city of Wales. Great, beautiful city. I went to school there. I went to a good school, my mom thought. She sent me to a predominantly white school. That's how she thought it was good. But she made a mistake. It was poor white.  Like, she didn't recognize it. It was two buses away. I had to go there every day. Just outside, right on the edge. And it was the kind of school where, it was a good school. It was the kind of school where, like, the dreams were big, but the windows were plastic. Did you guys know? Like, predominantly white, though. Predominantly white. She was right on that. Like, there were only two black kids in my school. There was my cousin, Saeed. And his mom copied my mom. And there was Fuad. You might notice my name is missing off that list. I wasn't cool enough to be black in my school. I got demoted to Asian.  uh no i can say that all my friends are asian and they're all doing much better in life than me all right like my one friend rahan he's studying nuclear engineering at university yeah yeah yeah but he's a pakistani muslim studying nuclear engineering so you know i'll never let him leave like he has more money than me but i can go on holiday that's what i'm saying  No, it's great. It's great. Rohan is the best of my friends. Not my best friend, just the best of my friends. He's like, he's the best. Like, puberty hit. He got attractive. We never told him. So we could keep him. Do you guys have this? Like, you have an attractive person in your group that you can keep to get into places, but you never let them know? It's like having a baby elephant so you can chain it up when it's young. And then when it gets big, you can ride it around town. Yeah? Rohan was that elephant.  Like, our first ever house party, I wasn't even invited. Rohan was. But he got invited by the popular girl. We told him he'll never be loved. I got to go. That's how it works. It was an OK party. It was smart casual. That was the dress code. So I wore a vest, and he wore a blazer. But they were from the same three-piece suit, all right? So we looked like a unit, you know? And then we turned up to this girl's house. Now, this girl was posh. We didn't realize how posh she was until we arrived. We got to this girl's house. We got to the front. We got to the house.  But get this, that's not where the house started. Yeah? Do you guys get that? Like, the house was here, but the house house, the house house was way over there. Like, you go to my house, you take two steps in. You're in my neighbor's house.  It was a good house party. She showed us around, showed us to the back. She had three conservatories, or conservatoires, I suggested. And she told me to shut up, that I wasn't invited. So we carried on. First ever house party, we get in, OK? First conservatory, there's eight people sat there. And it's not exactly like I imagined, I'll be honest. Because all my ideas of house parties were from that TV show, Skins.  Yeah, do you guys remember that? So I thought it was going to be like sex, drugs, someone would turn up with a baby. That's where season two kicks off. Like, that's what I thought it was going to be like. But we get there. It's just eight people sat in a circle. They're all kind of playing this like, you know, depression Olympics, like this victim Olympics. Very middle class problems. So they're all like, they're all like, oh, my parents, you know, they've split up because they were together first. You guys know? Or...  Or they were like, oh, you know, my dad didn't buy me FIFA because she knew her dad. See, that's... Or she was like, this one girl was like, oh, my boyfriend got hit by a bus. She won. But you should have heard her talking. I think he jumped. Like, that's...  It's not true. It's not true. But it was great. It was all right. We stayed there for 27 minutes. Honestly, I really resent it, because I stopped being Muslim to drink, all right? Yeah, yeah, figure that one out, all right? What a Faustian bargain that was. Because now, I feel like I've completed drinking, and I'm finished. Like, there's nowhere to go from here. And you can't go backwards drinking. Have you tried? Have you tried to go backwards? It's horrible. Like, I tried to buy a Lamborghini recently.  Got diabetes. Straight away. Straight away. They just amputated in the shop. That was it.  You can't. You can't go backwards. But I'll tell you this, OK? My grandmother would always say, you have to carry on forward. That's the only thing you can do. You can only carry on forward. She had all these phrases, my grandmother. Very wise woman. She used to say stuff like, a wash pot never kettles. Dementia. We didn't know, right? But she had all these other, she had all these beautiful phrases. She always used to say, you should love what you do, which is how I got into this. She always used to say to me, show me the rich man who is happy, and then take his money. That's the pirate life, guys. Guys, thank you very much. I've been Mo Omar. Cheers.
