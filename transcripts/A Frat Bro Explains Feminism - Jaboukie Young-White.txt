 You guys are way too sweet, man. You guys are way too sweet. So tonight, I want to start off talking about something a little important, right? Something that I think applies to a lot of us. It's a popular topic today. Feminism. But with a little bit of a twist tonight, right? Feminism... ...for men! Yeah, sorry, ladies, you know?  But, like, for real, sorry. Okay, so, like, yes, you know, like, men can be feminists, right? Like, my bro's always like, Chad, how can you be a feminist if you're always trying to get girls, you know? And I'm like, whoa, don't mansplain me. Chill. And if you guys don't mind, I'd love to share a really quick anecdote with you, if that's cool. So I was pledging at ASU Go Devils, and...  I noticed, like, when I was sitting down to pee, I was getting drunk a lot, I was, like, sitting down to pee, and noticed, like... something, like, wrong, you know? But it turns out, no, that's just the beginning stages of male feminism, everybody! Happens to everybody. Okay, so, what is feminism, right? That's a question that's on everybody's mind, and only Lena Dunham really seems to know the answer, so...  I'd love to, like, just, also, before I start this part of the show, fam, which is my favorite gender-neutral way to address a crowd, if I ask you a question, feel free to answer from your heart, not necessarily your mind, right? So, if you were going to say, like, what is feminism, what would you say?  Equality between the sexes. Okay, equality between the sexes. Give it up! Yeah! All right, all right. And if you were gonna just, like, spitball a year, spitball a year that feminism started, what would you say? Ooh, 1970? 1970s, okay, give it up. Um, close. It was actually, uh...  It's actually 2013. It was started by the musical recording artist Beyonce. She has this album that really breaks everything down. I couldn't get the rights to play it even though my dad is a fucking lawyer. I just got this quote that sort of just breaks everything down. Visionary feminism is a wise and loving politics. It is rooted in the love of male and female being, refusing to privilege one over the other. Who do you think said that? Beyonce. Okay, close. It was actually...  Solange. The creator of black feminism. That's just a feminist enjoying nature.  all right, you guys are probably like, okay, Chad, like how could you just drag us like this and like not give us anything to do? And it's like, well, I'll give you guys something very actionable that we could all start doing right now. We gotta stop cat calling you guys. We gotta stop it. I personally, I never really like cat called in real life. I was more of like a digital cat caller. I would just like open Tinder messages and be like, what's up queen? My face is a throne, you know, like just sort of.  stuff like that, but I don't do that anymore, because I'm wiser. Now, I just drop facts about female scientists. Rosalind Franklin is remembered for her breakthrough discoveries in the structure of DNA that she never celebrated due to an untimely death, baby girl. Works every time. Put your own spin on it, you know?  Follow me on Twitter at wokewoke94, everybody! Okay, what's up, you guys? What's up, New Orleans? Yeah, oh my God. What's up?  I'm so happy to be in New Orleans. It's way colder than I was expecting it to be here. It's, like, a dangerous level of cold outside right now, where, like, a cold wind blows, you just, like, wake up in an Ikea, like, three years deep into a monogamous relationship, you know? You drink a latte too fast, you're just, like, at your own flash mob proposal, just like, what happened? I was living in L.A. for a year. That shit was whack, honestly.  It was wack. I, like, tried doing, like, all the California stuff, too, like, when I was out there. I tried going vegan for a while. Very up-and-down process, mostly just because whenever I would stand up, I would just, like... pass out. Wake up, someone's doing my birth chart for me.  I also tried yoga while I was in LA, because I was like, yoga's easy, right? That's just like laying on the ground for 45 minutes. I could do that. And then like halfway through the first class, I was just like shaking. The instructor came up to me like, you can give up or you can try. I was like, oh my God. I feel so attacked by this dude in a spiritual gangster crop top. Trying to gentrify my muscles right now.  I also love how yoga has basically just become like a slow electric slide for white people at this point. Like, to the left. Take it back now, y'all. Now maintaining that breath one hop this time.  Also, white people, y'all went the fuck off when you made buffalo cauliflower. That's so good. Keep that energy up. Stop calling the cops. Get in the kitchen. Honestly.  But I was like, you know what? Any exercise I do is going to be difficult. That's kind of the point of exercise. I might as well go all the way. I'm going to take an MMA class. I'm going to learn how to fight.  I did learn one cool thing from this class. I learned that if someone is attacking you standing up like this, right, what you got to do is you got to stick your arm up, twist your body, drop your elbow. You can get out of the hold safe, right? But the instructor prefaced that saying, like, sometimes you're in the middle of a fight. You don't have time to do all that choreo or whatever. You got to do whatever it takes to get out of that hold. And I was like, okay, Beck, got you. My sparring partner put his hand around my throat, and I went, Daddy.  And he let go, you know? Sometimes love wins. That's all it takes.
