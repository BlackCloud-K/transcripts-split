 Mr. Artie Lang, everybody. Here's the story. I come out here in 1995 to do a show called Mad TV. It was a sketch comedy show. Oh, well, thank you. All right. So one of the sketches we did was called Babe Watch. And that was Babe the Pig in Baywatch. My hand to God. So guess who played Babe the Pig?  Come on. We had a big budget, so we shot it on location in Malibu. It was a two-day shoot. I go out there. I had to be there at 4 a.m. to get three hours of pig prosthetics, a pig face, a pig snout, six teats, the bikini top on each one. That was the joke. And I said, I'm not going to get through this without cocaine. Not going to happen.  So my Coke dealer in New York hooked me up with this guy, a contact he had in L.A., who was a Coke dealer. And this guy, he was the best cocaine dealer ever. He was always right on time. You called him, he was like, I'm there, you know. So I call him. I call him from the set. And I go, dude, you got to fucking, you got to meet me on the Pacific Coast Highway. I got to get something from you. I got to get an eight ball from you. And he goes, all right, all right. Can you get to this restaurant, Duke's? Can you get to the restaurant?  And I'm like, yeah, yeah, I think I can. So I hang up with him. I look around. Now I'm in every shot of this sketch. I look at the assistant directors. I'm not looking for two seconds. I run to my car. I get in my car, and I speed the fuck away. I just speed away. I'm doing, like, at 90 miles an hour. Looking, I'm telling you, exactly like a pig.  I get the Dukes, I pull in. He's already there. The fucking guy, he goes, what, you had a brunch at Dukes? What happened? Now, I never told him I was on a TV show because I was afraid to, like, share my life with him. And I forget myself. He sees me get out of this car. And he looks at me.  I'll never forget the look on his face. He looks at me and goes... Damn, man, what kind of crazy shit are you into? He probably thought I was at some crazy drug party, you know?  I get back in my car and I put some Coke on the end of a key. I go to do it. I can't get the Coke through the pigs now. I can't do it. So now I'm thinking, I'm the only one in the history of the world who's ever had this problem.  So now three hours of prosthetics I went through, okay? So I'm like, fuck it. I make a decision. I break the fucking nose, which means when I get back there, it's going to be an hour of fixing it before we shoot. I'm in every shot.  So I break the fucking big nose. I do a couple of blasts. I'm like, okay, I'm fine. Now I get back on the Pacific Coast Highway. I rush back towards Oxnard. I stop at a light at Topanga Canyon, and I figure I'm gonna do another hit. I got it up to my nose like this. I look over, and there's this beautiful woman in a Lamborghini. This is the look on her face.  And I realize she's looking at a pig driving a car doing cocaine. Then I'm thinking, you know, fuck her. It's LA. It's probably the third time she saw that that day.  So I do another hit. I drive. I get to the fucking set. Everybody wants to kill me. But they can't really say it yet because we got to do 14 hours of shooting. So they see that my fucking nose is fucked up. They have to redo my nose. Look, I was a fuck-up. Every two hours, I broke the nose again to do coke.  And every two hours, she had to fix it. And she knew what was going on. I wasn't fooling anybody. So this happens. We get through the day, and it's a nightmare. So we had a shoot the next day. They got us a little motel right on the ocean there, which was next to the shoot. So I go in. I fall asleep in the bed. I wake up the next morning. At some point during the night, every bad thing in my body must have just fell out of me. I shit the bed.  and I had a lot of bad in me. I wake up, you know, the scene in the Godfather, the horse's head, where he wakes up, he sees all the blood. I was like, I had shit all over the bed. I was late. I had no time to clean it up. I just, I took a steaming hot shower, got dressed, ran out. I had no time to clean up.  So I just threw the bedspread over all the shit. I mean, it was a river of shit. I had no cash for a tip. And I got there. I got through the day. Everything was fine. So we're driving home, and I'm thinking about the hotel, and I'm worried about it. I'm like, oh, well, you know, I'm just gonna have to be embarrassed by that. But then I realized the room wasn't in my name. The room was in the name of the first assistant director.  This guy, Josh. If they want to blame somebody, they're gonna say, this guy, Josh, you know, shit the bed and didn't clean up. My name's Artie Lang. That's my story.
