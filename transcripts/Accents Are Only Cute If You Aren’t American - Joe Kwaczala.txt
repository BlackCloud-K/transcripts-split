 Yeah, you could get away with whatever you want if you have a cute accent, but I think the opposite is true if you have a thick, regional, American accent. Then you can't get away with anything because everyone thinks you're dumb as shit.  And it's super unfair, you know? Like, I grew up in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, which has a very trashy accent. And it's so unfair because there are people in Pittsburgh with that accent who are very, very smart. But are they? I don't know. It's kind of hard to buy sometimes, you know?  Yeah, it's very hard to buy sometimes. Even the people in Pittsburgh who are in positions where you know just to get there, they have to be smart. Like imagine being in a courtroom in Pittsburgh and the judge walks in looking very distinguished, wearing the robe, and then he sits down and opens his mouth and says, okay, so nobody freak out or nothing, but jurors deliberated and concluded.  Defend us guilty beyond reasonable doubt. You'd be like, uh, are you sure? Can we put you in jail? Is that an option to put the judge in jail? The reason I say is because the way you talk makes it sound like you've maybe stabbed someone over a sausage argument.  This guy's trying to freaking tell me kill bosses, not top five sausage. What am I supposed to do, not shank them? Get out of here. That's how people talk in Pittsburgh. And sausage is like a top priority for most of the people I grew up with in Pittsburgh. It's messed up. Thank you.  I use the British accent a lot. I think it's my favorite voice to do. Really love the British accent. I love that you can tell just how British someone is by how many syllables they use. Like regular British, now. Really British, now. Super British, now.  And then the most British is that plus a million super short fake sounding words at the end.  I used to have a boss who was British. Why do you think I got fired?  Could it have been something I had done? We'll never know. No, we do know. We know why I got fired at that job. It was because I was bad at it. Yeah, that was it. I was very bad at this office job. The only thing I was good at, honestly, was farting quietly. That I was...  incredible at. It's a skill that you develop like any other. But even as good as I was at farting quietly, I would occasionally let out an audible fart. You know, I'm human. And I found every time I would, I'd immediately start banging things around on my desk, like slapping the table, opening and closing drawers. Because in my head, I thought I was going to replicate the sound of the fart.  with something else. And usually it would be like rubbing my vinyl chair. Usually that would sound a lot like a fart. So you'd be like, oh, this is great. Do this a whole bunch, get a whole bunch of reps in. So if anyone had initially heard me, they'll now think, oh, Joe didn't fart. He was just rubbing his chair. Of course.  But what they were probably really thinking was, hey, Joe farted. He definitely farted. And then fell down on a bunch of shit. And then farted like 10 more times. What a maniac. We should fire him. And they did.  They did fire me. I was without a job for a long time. I didn't care, you know. I liked going on job interviews. I thought that was very funny because they would always ask me the same question. They would always ask me, Joe, do you think outside the box? Do you know that box, Joe? Do you think outside it? And that was so funny to me because every job I was applying for was like an entry-level position. So all I would be doing at the job would be like answering the phones.  And I don't think you want me answering the phones for your company outside the box. I don't think that would be very good for you if I was at the front desk and I was like, thank you for calling the offices of Jackson and Miller. Goodbye. That's why you don't hire a bad boy.
