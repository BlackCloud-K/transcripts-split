 Here's the first place my mum saw me do stand-up. It was about four years ago. And to give you an idea of how little she understood the evening, she bought four tickets to the show. One for herself, one for my dad, one for my sister, and one for me! She did not understand it, but she finds it weird that I do this job. She doesn't like it. She thinks I should be a rich person by now and have lads. But, like, my parents' generation, they're just on another planet. Like, my mum's got a drawer just for wrapping paper.  Various types of wrapping paper. I keep my jeans in the same drawer that I keep my mustard. I think they want me to have a proper job and stuff, but I just can't do it. I can't do job interviews. Because my small talk is so shit. I know small talk is meant to be questions like, how are you? What have you been doing? I don't know what it's meant to be, but I always mess it up slightly and say something like, where is your father? Or like, what will you buy in February? And...  It's stupid. I should be better at it now. I'm a grown-up. But, like, by the way, I only realised I was a grown-up recently when I realised you can have profiteroles whenever you want. You know you can just buy profiteroles. But since I'm at an event, I see profiteroles, I'm always like... How many profiteroles are we allowed? I don't know, as many as you want. So, four?  And I don't realise, I think, the reason I get embarrassed and nervous in job interviews, I assume the person thinks I'm stupid, all my friends think I'm stupid. And I know that from the frequency with which my friends show me how to use their shower. Most insulting thing you can show someone. So this one turns it on. Okay. And you see this blue and red one? Go on.
