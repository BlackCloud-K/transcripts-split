 What would I tell her? If I was to tell my younger self something now, I would tell her... Me?  The stuff that you're currently getting in trouble for, you'll get paid for it later. Just hone it in quicker. What would I tell young people right now? I would tell them so much. My younger self would like to know that when you have a brush, the pills that they give you are actually to put inside your vagina and not to swallow. And when you swallow them, it does give you a cold body rash. So stop doing that and stop reading the instructions.  Stop straightening your hair. It gets better, it gets better. I would tell young Katie, I would tell young Evelyn, do not text him. Don't sleep with that guy. Blog him that you slept with.  Don't talk to him ever again. You know who. If it's about to happen, just don't do it. Don't do it. Just walk away. I would tell, like, probably six months ago, Kate, to be fair. And be more confident. I don't know how to do that yet, but do that, Kate. Do that. Just be yourself and don't worry what anyone else is telling you. Just embrace who you are as a person because you are amazing. Oh...  I would say leave Cornwall and know it's all going to be okay. The best advice that me now could give to little, little Helen wandering around flea would be... That you're trans, so save 15 years of your life trying to figure it out and just realise that it is indeed true. That would probably be the most helpful thing. Why would you leave Cornwall?  Never step in a puddle if you can't remember the last time it rained because you will get a lot of piss on you. If you want to do something, literally just do it. Don't wait. Don't put it on. And then before you know it, it's going to be 10 years. So if you've got a passion about something, pursue it. And if you pursue it and you work hard, you'll get where I am today.  Oh my god, I would tell young people not to get a perm because it's the late noughties and no one else has a perm and you look ridiculous. You look ridiculous! That's what I would say. Comfy clothing is never the wrong option and always just go comfy. When you think you need to wear high heels and tight stuff, you don't, just always go comfy. Flat shoes, pyjamas, no one will judge you.  Things happen for a reason. Everything kind of just falls into place. You don't have to panic. You don't have to worry. You don't have to look at other people, worry about other people's destinations, because your destination is coming. Yeah. Yeah, it's going to be very close steps. God's planning everything. It's all right. It's okay. It's all right.  I think I would say that you're not going to expect all the great things that are going to happen to you. It's really nice when you grow up. It's real nice. And to keep writing. Keep actually writing. Actually write stuff down when they happen to you. Write them down because they're funny and they'll be useful later. And don't be stupid. And I love you.
