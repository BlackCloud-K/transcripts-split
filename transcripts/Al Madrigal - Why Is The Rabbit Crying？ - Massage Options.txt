 Not sure if anyone's done this. Over the age of 35, I hurt my neck sleeping. You ever do that? I was dreaming of falling down the steps. Now, as a man, you have very few massage options.  Option number one, I could trade one with my wife. Three minutes in, she's gonna complain her hand is tired. Then I'm gonna owe her one. It's a bad deal. Number two, the chair. You ever go to the mall? See the uniformed Chinese guys? Want you to get in a chair, sit ass out, Patsy style. Put your face in the donut that's seen a thousand other faces.  A germaphobe. I'm gonna put it in there. It's disgusting. Not to mention, it's all open air. I got some fat kid eating a piece of Sparrow right next to me. It's not relaxing. It's not gonna work. Option number three. Fancy place. Spa. Real spa.  I don't have that kind of time. I don't need to spend four hours in some cucumber water utopian environment. I don't have the time. I want jiffy lube of neck fixing. I don't want to go to some relaxation room. We got some menopausal hippie lady walking around with an open robe, some car crash of a vagina hanging out. Gonna give somebody a last look before they retire it for good. It's gross. I don't have the time or the stomach.  Brings me to option number four, strip mall massage. You guys know what I'm talking about? Huh? You especially know what I'm talking about. You know, the strip mall, too. Bunch of shitty businesses that got together to become roommates. Always a Quiznos nail salon.  Liberty tax. They conned some poor Mexican-American teenager to dress up like the Statue of Liberty. That's right. They'd be ashamed of themselves.
