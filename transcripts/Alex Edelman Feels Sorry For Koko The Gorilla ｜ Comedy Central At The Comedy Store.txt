 Has anyone heard of Coco the gorilla? Yes, a few of you. For the rest of you guys who don't know, Coco the gorilla, this is true, is a gorilla that speaks fluent sign language. This is 100% true. In 1999, Coco met Robin Williams. And last year, they told Coco that Robin Williams had passed away, and Coco went, Coco friend, Coco sad.  Yes, which is sad, but on the plus side, how funny was Robin Williams that even gorillas were like, this guy is hilarious. I'm a gorilla. I live in a zoo. Do you know how many people I meet? I met this guy once in the 90s, changed my life. Second of all, and obviously, did they have to tell?  the gorilla that Robin Williams had passed away? She wasn't gonna read about it or see it on television or anything like that. Someone walked into a gorilla enclosure in September of 2017 and they're like... Hi, Coco? Could you put down the banana?  And they tell Coco and Coco's like, oh no. But Prince is fine, right?  What did she... Coco, calm down. Get the gun. Coco, calm down. Coco's like, Coco, there hasn't been a Kevin Spacey movie this year. They're like, Coco? Coco? Coco's like, who's running for president? They're like, Coco. Should we tell her it's a relative of hers? Coco, calm down.  And Coco's like, I guess I'll just call my cousin Harambe in Cincinnati. And they're like, Coco, you owed for Harambe, but not Robin Williams.
