 Please give it up for Ali Sadiq, everybody. Let him hear it. Ali Sadiq. My story is about prison danger, seeing that I look so menacing, you know. And I'm black, so you know it's going to be about crime. Let me tell you, prison is an odd place because you do not know the rules. No matter how many...  Prison movies you've watched and documentaries are locked up. You still don't know the rules of what's gonna happen. So I'm on my way to what they call necessities. Necessities is, you know, where your clothes, you get your laundry and all that bullshit. So I'm walking to necessities, and a dude just walks by and say, Mexican got on boots. I'm like, what the does that mean?  Because it's like, what you mean Mexican got on boots? Everybody got on boots. So I thought. Dude walk past, Mexican got on boots. So I tell somebody else, Mexican got on boots. Dude look down and say, Mexican do have on boots and just take off running. I'm like, was I supposed to run? Because the Mexicans have on boots?  So I asked the old dude, I said, hey, Mexicans got on boots? He said, all right, they got on boots. I said, what that mean? He said, it's going to be a riot. I said, you pretty calm about a riot. I said, how you know Mexicans got on boots mean it's going to have a riot? He said, because Mexicans don't wear boots on the rec yard. What they wear on the rec yard? He said, sneakers. They play handball all the time.  So I'm like, still don't comprehend. So I get back to my cell. I say, hey, you Mexican. What Mexican got on boots mean? He say, that mean we gonna ride. We gonna stab a couple of black guys up. And I asked, does the ride happen in here? Like in this cell?  Because me and you just finished eating together. What you mad at me about? I don't know. Find a black dude, I'm like, yo, so what I do now, the Mexican got on boots. They say, man, look, you gonna need to find a dude named CeCe and get you a knife. There's 3,000 people on this unit. How the I'm supposed to find CeCe? I don't know.  So I'm just walking around, Mexican on boots, CeCe. Mexican on boots, CeCe. Dude walk, what up, CeCe? I said, that's what I'm looking for right there. I say, CeCe, I need a knife. He said, what type of knife? I don't know, I just out here.  So he put up a towel, went under his mattress, took some shit out, slid some shit back, and now it's eight knives in front of me. It's like I'm at Macy's. I'm like, you know, what kind of knife you want? I said, well, you know what kind of knife I need for a ride? I ain't never been to a ride before. He said, I suggest something personal. I said, man, how much is a personal knife gonna cost me? Two bags of coffee. Come back a little later on in the day.  I say, cool, Cece. So I wait three or four hours, and I knew he was working on my knife, because I was down the cell, and I heard on the ground. I say, yeah, my knife going to be sharper than a mother . So then this dude named Mitch say, hey, you getting you a knife? I say, yeah, Cece working on my knife. He say, man, you need more than that.  I said, what I need now? He said, you need to know about how to fight in the riot. He said, Mexican got on boots. This is the reason why they have on boots, so they can kick you.  in this shin while you fighting. Boots are made out of metal. So you got to do this. This is Mitch. This is in my cell teaching me how to be in a riot. Look, first of all, you're going to have to do a rock and lean. Mexicans are going to come out there. They're going to have their knives. You're going to have to have your shirt off with your knife. And when you do this, you're going to have to rock to see what foot the Mexican going to kick you with.  I said, this is too much. This is too much. It's like a choreographed dance. I don't know what the I'm doing. So I'm waiting to get my knife. I go back to CeCe. I say, yo, CeCe, I need my knife. He say, man, I just sold your knife. I say, man, what the , CeCe? You said it was a personal knife. For me, it cost two bags of coffee. Why it's not personal no more? He say, man, it was personal.  Then a dude came in with three bags of coffee, then he made it business. I said, the ride about to jump off. Hey man, do what you can do. So I'm out there rocking with no knife. I've been practicing this shit for two hours, rocking. I'm not getting kicked, but I'm getting cut. I got cut down my side from a Mexican who didn't even have on boots.
