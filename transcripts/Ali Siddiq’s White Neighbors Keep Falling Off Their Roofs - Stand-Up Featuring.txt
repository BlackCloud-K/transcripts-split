 If you at your house and you dig in a trench and the trench collapses on you and you die, should your family dig you up?  to rebury you? I'm just asking. This is a serious question. Because I know I wouldn't. I know I wouldn't dig you up to rebury. I would kick the rest of that dirt over you, and I would say a prayer. At least I could tell people that you at home. At least I could say that.  I'm old enough to know things that I like and I don't like. Things that I think that make sense and things that I know make absolutely no sense. If you are raising a child and your child is being cyber bullied, you're raising a weak ass child.  I don't know what the fuck cyberbullying is or why your dumb ass baby would sit there and read mean messages and be scared. I don't fucking know. Instead of just closing the laptop, I just don't fucking get it. What do they think gonna happen if they close the laptop? Do they think the cyberbully gonna open the laptop? Bitch, don't be closing me. What do they think?  It's going to happen. Okay. I like the fact that young white boys get they friends drunk and leave them random places. When you see a white boy in a fountain,  Nothing's wrong, his friends did that. Find out his name, look on his Facebook page, you gonna see somebody, look at Charles, he's shit-faced. I like that. I like the fact that young white people will play tricks on each other like that. They will take each other to the movie, somebody fall asleep.  they put popcorn in his mouth and leave out the movie and wait on him to wake up and walk outside. And they laugh, we fucking left you. Let me tell you something. I'm black and I'm grown. If you leave me in a movie sleep with popcorn in my mouth, you better not fucking be outside when I get out there. We'll beat your ass down.  Fucking too grown for that. I live in a gated community in Houston, in a white neighborhood. I like this about old white men, that y'all are not embarrassed to embarrass yourself in front of your children. I like that.  I'm black, I don't embarrass myself in front of my kids. I keep it pretty straight laced. Every white man on my side of the street has fallen off his roof in front of his son. It's so much, I know the sound now. I don't even have to look. I know the sound. I'm in my garden minding my own business and all of a sudden, see?  Ted ass is off the roof again. And I always look over the roof. I'm like, Ted, hey, man. I know you voted for that wall. You might want to ask the Mexicans something before they leave, man. Because they ain't never off the roof, dog. They ain't never off the roof. You got the wrong shoes on, dog. Bring up that wall because I'm fucking mad.  about that wall. I'm still the only person really fucking mad about that wall, because the fucking wall shit is fucking stupid to me. And see, most people that think about the wall, they don't have to see the wall. I live in Texas. I'm going to have to see this dumbass wall. And it bothers me. It bothers me, because Texas used to be Mexico. And you trying to fucking build a wall, stop Mexicans from coming back to what used to be Mexico? Mexicans are looking over the wall like, look, my grandmama house is right there.  My baby pictures are still in the damn window. It's dumb. Fucking dumb. I want to spend tax dollars to build a wall. See, I used to then concern myself with tax dollars. I sold drugs and I wasn't paying taxes. So that was y'all money to do with it as you wished. But now, you know, I'm a upstanding citizen and I'm concerned about how you spending my fucking tax dollars.  I am, man. You want to build a fucking wall? Shit don't even make sense. You want to build a wall for people who have tunnels? That's dumb as hell. Maybe you need a visual. Maybe you need a visual. Wall. Tunnel. They dug El Chapo out of prison twice in a nice-ass tunnel. It was well lit. He had a motorcycle.  he drove out the tunnel. You know he drove out the fucking tunnel. You know what kind of motorcycle he drove? A Harley, which is only made in America. They already have a tunnel! Do you know we have a perfectly functioning wall in Arizona? Perfectly functioning wall in Arizona. Six months ago in the Wall Street Journal, they busted a ring of people  catapulting Mexican people over. Fucking catapulting some medieval shit. Do you know how bad you want to get someone to let somebody throw your ass over a wall without nobody on the other side guaranteed to catch you? Ain't nobody doing this shit. Which one I'm supposed to grab? Who I'm supposed to get? They released the footage. You ain't gotta believe me. Look at it. Google it. They released the fucking footage. It has three million views.  Two million of the views are mine alone. I watch that shit every day. Fucking hysterical. I watch it every day. They got Mexican people in regular chairs with seat belts on the chairs. Now that's amazing in itself. Fucking seat belt on a regular chair. They give them helmets and mouthpieces. It's fucking crazy. They put the mouthpiece in, thumbs up, catapult it over the goddamn wall. Every time I see it, I think in my mind, who went first?  Because I know they didn't get this shit right the first time. You're sitting in the chair. Your seat belted in. You got your helmet, put your mouthpiece in, you gone. Halfway in the middle that you notice, I don't think I'm up high enough to get over this wall. Boom, right into the goddamn wall. Now you're not going to stop because you done paid your money. You got to keep going.  All right. Yeah, I'm tired now. I'm done. I don't leave on no big joke or nothing. I just pretty much leave when I'm done. So I'm going to give y'all a tip, because I see a lot of people here with glasses on. And I have a tip for people who wear glasses. If you wear glasses,  you should get your prescription put inside your windshield. This is genius shit. So can't nobody steal your car. Somebody get in your car, I can't see shit in this car. This must be a nearsighted car.
