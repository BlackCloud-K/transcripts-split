 One time I slept with a Nigerian girl. We were 69 and we looked like the yin yang symbol. Yeah, both finished at the same time though. How's that for balance? Lovely to be here. I'm from London, which is fun because there's a lot of tourists. My favorite kind of tourists are the people who come to the UK for Harry Potter because we made them up. Do they not know?  He never lived here. Are you guys finding this out for the first time? You see them down at King's Cross? Like, oh my God, is this where he went through platform nine and three quarters? And some English folks just like, uh, yeah, 20 quid to see that, 20 quid. Give me 40 quid, I'll show you where Hermione was born. It's just behind this JD Sports over here. 60 quid, you can smell Hagrid's fart, it's incredible.  We've got Harry Potter tours. Is that just pointing out places where nothing happened? You can go on a Harry Potter tour right now. Close your eyes. There you go. Fly around Hogwarts. Enjoy yourselves. I'm going on dates again because I recently had a breakup. I'm over it. It's fine. She was a huge Harry Potter fan.  And I hate going through a breakup because your friends give you really annoying advice. Like, the most common advice I get now is, well, it's better to have loved and lost. Which is true, but once you've loved, what's your alternative? To have loved and won? What even is that? Do you outlive them? At their funeral, going up to the casket, like, one deal? Yes!  Take your top off to a lap of honour of the wake. Little Sambra on the grave. It was a great relationship. I'm very glad it happened. It was a great relationship. This is how great the relationship was. One of the biggest issues we had was that she was hornier than me. I know. I didn't even think that would ever be an issue. When I was a teenage boy in this department, I was confident.  I was there on the playground with other boys. The thing about me is I need to have sex every day. I need to have sex every day. Because I'm a machine. I had sex three times during geography. I was a virgin, by the way. I need to have sex every day because I'm a machine. I need to have sex every day. But when you're faced with the reality, it's horrifying.  I had no problem with the fact she wanted to have sex every day. The problem is she wanted it to be good. I've got one good one in me a year. I need time. I need prep. One night she wanted to have sex after a curry. That's illegal. We tried. It was awful just having our bellies slapping against each other. She's on top. I'm holding in a fart. It's embarrassing. You ever run out of breath during sex? It's demoralizing. You're there like, I'm finished. Did you come? No, I'm just finished. I'm done.  Oh, come on, Pleasance, I know you're a theatre bug. grow up. He's talking about sex. But hey, we started drifting apart. Didn't have sex as much. I remember towards the end, as she switched, I wanted to have sex. She didn't, fair enough. She said, I don't want to have sex. I just don't feel sexy. I don't think I've ever.  I felt sexy. I can't remember a time where I've hopped out of the shower, caught a glimpse of my pale, hairy, ginger body and thought, well, well, well, she is a lucky girl, isn't she? Hitting this sweet piece daily, bow! Not even during sex do I feel sexy, I feel grateful.  Give a cool glimpse of yourself having sex. Oh, my God, I'm so pasty. I look like a haunting. Jesus, paranormal shag-tivity going on in there. One time I slept with a Nigerian girl. We were 60, 90. We looked like the yin-yang symbol. Yeah, both finished at the same time, though. How's that for balance? You guys have been really lovely. You have. Appreciate you.  That wasn't about class. Why am I going to laugh at that? If you want to follow me, my name's Ali Woods. I used to like my name, Ali Woods, right, until I did a gig in Glasgow where the MC there introduced me by going, ladies and gentlemen, now time for a man whose name is two places you can get molesterin'. Ali Woods!  It was especially annoying as well because I actually changed my name to Ali Woods. It's not my real name. My real name is Church, your uncle's house. You guys have been great. Take care.
