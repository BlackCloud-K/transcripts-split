 Nobody tells the truth about food anymore. Watch this. Who eats at McDonald's? Hands in the air. OK. 17 people. What we've done then, ladies and gentlemen, we've separated the audience in two groups. Everyone with their hand in the air eats at McDonald's. Everyone with their hand down is a fucking liar. Nobody likes to admit to eating at McDonald's anymore. I can walk into McDonald's right now with this microphone and be like, does anyone in this restaurant eat at McDonald's? Every dickhead in there, no, I was looking for Whole Foods, man.  I get confused with M's and W's. I don't know what's going on. Right, no one even admits to selling you McDonald's. Watch a McDonald's advert. They're like, we sell salads now. It's like, no, you don't. No, you don't. You've put salads on the menu. You haven't sold one of those fucking things. Right, the McDonald's chicken salad is the only item on the menu that looks exactly like the picture if you order it. You know why? They only made one. They haven't fucking sold it yet. Still...  Do you know what I miss, man, when fast food companies used to talk about the food? I walked past a McDonald's post that had a picture of a Big Mac and it said something like, now with 100% beef. I'm just like, what the fuck do you mean now? I've been eating them things for years. How much toad was in the previous recipe? There's no honesty, I'll prove it to you, right? What's the McDonald's advertising strapline?  something that nobody ever says right a good advertising strapline is something you say in your head right like Nike just do it I have said that and I've been for a run okay have a break have a Kit Kat I have said that and I have had a Kit Kat I have never seen anyone above the age of nine say the words I'm loving it on the way into a McDonald's right they have definitely never said it on the way out if you come out of a McDonald's going I'm absolutely loving it it's like mate you did it wrong  Go back in there till you fucking hate yourself. Go back in there.
