 And I know when I'm really in love and feel really stable in a relationship, and I don't know if anyone else does this, but as soon as I'm really comfy in it and feeling really in love, I start playing a game. And the game is called Would You Still Love Me If...  I found my person. Yay, thank you. And I don't want to get soppy, but I'll tell you the exact moment I knew I wanted to spend the rest of my life with him, right? So, we was in his flat. He turns to me out of nowhere and he says, the most poetic thing I've ever heard come out of a human's mouth, right? In a sentence, he captured everything I wanted in my life. He said this, right?  He just looked at me and he went, why is it? Why is it we don't put butter on chips? Mind blown, why don't we? We know potato and butter goes so well. This boy has seen through the matrix. He's a keeper, he's the one.  And I know when I'm really in love and feel really stable in a relationship, and I don't know if anyone else does this, but as soon as I'm really comfy in it and feeling really in love, I start playing a game. And the game is called, would you still love me if... Does anyone play it? Yes, good, good, good. If you don't play, it's really simple. So you just turn to the person you love and you submit them to psychological testing.  but in a cute way. And you can say anything because there's only one right answer. So you say anything like, would you still love me if my mouth was a bumhole? And they have to go, yes. And then you go, oh, brilliant. Kiss, kiss, kiss. It's great. And one day, we were sat doing our favorite thing in the entire world, which just happens to be watching ITV's The Chase. Have you seen The Chase? Yes, we love The Chase. We got a favorite chaser.  Yeah, Mark LaBette the Beast, right? We love Mark LaBette the Beast. When he comes on, we've got a chant. Mark LaBette gets you wet. We love Mark LaBette the Beast, right? So we sat in his flat watching Mark LaBette the Beast. We had a big bowl of buttery chips. Life was good. So I turned to him feeling very, very in love and I say, babe, would you still love me if I had Mark LaBette the Beast from The Chase's Hair?  I was very confident, sat back, waited for my delicious yes, and he went...  he doesn't know how to play the game. Silly. Let me explain. I was like, no, sorry, you don't get it. So basically, it's all me. Everything's exactly the same. It's all me. All me, who you love. Everything's exactly the same. The only difference, the only tiny little difference is I've got Mark Labette, the beast from the chase's hair. And he went, oh. No.  Do you just want to, let's just pause the chair for a sec. Yeah. No, no, I know it's a game. I am having fun. I am having fun. I'm not taking it seriously. No, I'm just, no, it's just interesting to me. It's just, no, I'm just saying it's interesting. Can you just put the chips down? It's just interesting to me.  that you wouldn't love me if I had short, black, spiky, gelled hair. No, I just found that. No, I'm not taking it seriously. I am having fun. I know it's a game. I'm just saying. It's weird, isn't it, that you wouldn't love me if I had short, black, spiky, gelled hair. And he said, Amy, you've got this wrong. Of course. Of course I would love you if you had short, black, spiky, gelled hair. But that's not what you're asking me.  You're asking me if I would love someone who went into a hairdresser's and specifically asked for Marc Labette, the beast from The Chase's hair. And I wouldn't. And I said, well, that is fair enough, yeah. That is fair enough, you know.  And then I broke up with him, because you've got to make a choice when it comes to Mark Labette. Does he get you wet? Does he not pick a lane? I will say, this won't make the edit, but I found out, but last week, did you know Mark Labette, the Beast from the Chase, has married his own cousin? Did anyone know that? I think that's absolutely fascinating. Imagine having such an incredible grasp of general knowledge.  I've no idea of your own family tree. Fantastic. You've been so lovely. Thank you so much for having me. Have a good evening. See you later.
