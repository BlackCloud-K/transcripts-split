 Yeah, my parents are from Africa, specifically Ethiopia. And the cool thing about having immigrant parents is that they'll do American traditions, but they won't do them the right way. They'll do them their own way. Like when I'd lose a tooth as a kid, there was no tooth fairy. Like I'd still get money, but it'd be, I'd hand my dad a tooth and he'd hand me a dollar.  It was a business transaction. I was just selling my dad baby teeth.  And growing up in an African household, I felt like I was never really exposed to black culture. Like, that was never given to me. No one ever sat me down and was like, this is earth, wind, and fire, and you're supposed to wear cocoa butter. Like, no one ever did that for me, you know? Because my parents didn't know anything about that. They were too busy cooking Ethiopian food and making my clothes smell like onions. Like, Ethiopian food tastes great, but if you cook it in a house, everything in that house now smells like onions. Everything, like the cat.  my Game Boy Advance. And I don't mean like if you took a raw onion, cut it down the middle and sniffed it. I mean like you take a bunch of onions, put them in a blender, puree that shit, mix it with olive oil, put it on a stove, boil that, hang a shirt on top of that.  Then let the onion vapors just soak and fester in that shirt. Then put that shirt on, and that's what I smelled like going to school in eighth grade. I smelled like I had hot boxed with some onions. And this is gonna come as a surprise to you, but smelling like onions does not lead to you being the most popular boy in school, okay?  Nah, that shit made me insecure. Like, I'm still insecure now. Do you guys ever do this? You ever say something in front of people, and then later, when you're by yourself, you'll say it out loud again to see if it sounded okay? I do that all the time. Even to just one guy, I'll just be like, all right, man, peace. Then, like, five seconds later, when he's out of earshot, I'm just like, all right, man, peace. Yeah, yeah, that was good. That was good.  It's wild how if you're insecure about something, then someone else points it out. You'll just remember that forever. Change your behavior from that day forward. Like, I have really big eyes. And when I was in middle school, my resting eye position was like this. I was just walking around like, hi, this is normal, hey. And a dude at lunch one day was like, nigga, why you look so surprised all the time?  And my reaction was to be like, this is my new resting eye position. Never gonna catch me looking surprised again.  just gonna look kinda high for the rest of my life. Man, I'm still insecure now. I don't feel comfortable doing something until I see someone that looks like me do it on TV or rap about it in a song first. I didn't feel comfortable skateboarding until I saw the music video for Lupe Fiasco's Kick Push in 2005. If you're not familiar, it's just black people skateboarding.  And I was like, black people skateboard? Well, I'm definitely gonna buy one now. You know, it's a positive thing. Like there's all these young black kids who now know they could be president because they saw Obama be president. I didn't know I could have depression because I've never seen a black dude in a commercial for antidepressants. Never. It's always some old white woman doing Tai Chi in the park. It's on some shit like this. There's like a cartoon bouncing ball. Even the ball is white.  Like, just once, I want to see one of these commercials aimed at me, you know, and my demographic. Just a commercial for black people written by white people, because you know that's what it would be, right? Just like one of those commercials that only comes on during Empire. This is what that commercial would look like. It'd just be a 22-year-old black dude. He's sitting on a basketball court.  It's in sepia tone. It's a sad rap beat playing in the background. Staring at a ball in between his legs all sad. Maybe he just got dunked on, I don't know. He looks up slowly at the camera and says, nigga, ask your doctor about Zoloft. That would help the streets so much.  I don't think antidepressants will ever become a street drug because an antidepressant drug deal just makes no sense. This is how it'd go down. It'd be like, hey man, I'm looking to get fucked up. What you got? Oh, I got this new shit you gotta try. Wellbutrin. Okay, is that a upper or a downer? How's it gonna make me feel? Check this, bro. It just makes everything a little easier to manage.  Okay, weird, well, I gotta drive later. How long does it take to hit? 30 days.
