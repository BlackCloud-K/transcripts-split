 In my family, it goes like this. John, Christie, Todd, Michael, okay? That's my name, Michael. Everyone has a friend named Michael. Everyone can pronounce the name Michael. It's not a difficult name to say, Michael. When I was born, my brother Todd was four. He tried to say my name Michael, but instead he said Mickle. Oh, isn't that so cute? Todd said Mickle.  Somehow, Mickle became Pickle. To this day, I am 30 years old. My entire family calls me Pickle because when Todd was four, he was and he couldn't say Michael. Michael. It's not hard. I'm in my dad's cell phone as Pickle because Todd is a head.  Pickle, dinner's ready. No, Mom, it's Michael, okay? You and Dad named me Michael. I hate my brother Toddles. And whenever Todd was bored, which was every day, because that's all older siblings are, is bored, miserable ass . He would grab his friends and they'd play this great game where they would take Michael's arms and they would forcefully tie him behind a tree trunk and they would tickle my armpits until I my pants.  The game would actually end when the tears would hit the in my pants. Tickle the pickle, Tilly . They had a name for the game. That's how often they were playing it. Tickle the pickle, Tilly , really? I'm a nine-year-old boy, right? I'm adorable at nine, little tiny little nine-year-old, leather jacket on.  Who are your heroes when you're nine? Your older brothers, that's who. And they took advantage of that big time, John and Todd. They used to play hide and go seek with me, but they wouldn't go seek. Who doesn't search for their nine-year-old brother? That game's called hide and go die, little brother. That's what that game's called. Okay, Pickle, here's how we play. You go find a real tight space with limited oxygen.  We're gonna go play Legends of Zelda for six and a half straight days. Hiding in my neighbor's car trunk. They're never gonna find me here. No, they're not, because they're not looking for you. Because they're .
