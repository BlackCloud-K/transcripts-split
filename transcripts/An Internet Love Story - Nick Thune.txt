 I would love to share a love story with you guys. This is a love story that actually documents my first experience with love growing up in Seattle, Washington. I was 14 years old, and it's titled Instant Messenger.  The year was 1994, and my dad brought home the first family computer. It was an Apple. Thanks, Dad. He brought it inside, and he put it on the table. He said, Nick, I can't set this up. I'm too old. I grabbed his hand. I said, I can do it, Eric. He said, call me Dad. I said, all right, Dad.  I had 1,253 minutes of AOL burning in my back pocket. My dad said, Nick, you're too young. Can't have your own screen name yet, but you can use mine. It was a salmon with an ERD at the end of it. Salmon Nerd. So I got online as Salmon Nerd. Found out about chatting pretty quick.  And that's where I met her. NSYNC Hottie 503. NSYNC Hottie 503. I haught her and she's a smiley face all over me. A smiley face on me. Sometimes NSYNC Hottie 503 would say stuff and I'd be like, what? And she'd be like, JK. And I'd be like, LOL.  Because you guys, I knew she was just kidding. But I was literally laughing out loud. And if you're doing that while talking to somebody on the internet, you have to tell them. I spent most of the day minimizing when my dad walked by.  InSyncHottie503 told me she was a 22-year-old actress just moved to Hollywood two months ago. She was nervous because the next day, which was tomorrow back then, she was going to be on TV for the first time, full house, TGIF. She was an extra.  I told her, hey, I know what it's like to be nervous. I have a pretty big next day myself because I'm going out to sea for six months. I'm a 25-year-old fisherman in Alaska. Deadliest salmon run known to man. I wasn't scared because they call me salmon nerd for a reason. At one point, I had to go to the bathroom.  So I wrote BRB and I came back a few minutes later and NSYNC Hottie 503 had written question mark, question mark, frowny face. And I said, listen, I'm sorry NSYNC Hottie 503, but BRB means be right back. She said, no salmon nerd, I know what BRB means, but I don't know if you are gonna BRB from that salmon run. And that's when I said caps lock, don't do this right now.  to stop yelling at me. I said, sorry in lowercase. I said, listen, I can't lie to you anymore. I'm a 14-year-old kid in Seattle, and I'm scared. She said, where's cattle? And I was like, you know, that's a stupid abbreviation on my part. It's Seattle.  A few minutes went by. No response. Sign off, sign on. Sign off, sign off. Finally, she said, salmonerd? And I said, yes, NSYNC hottie 503 dot, dot, dot. She said, I know who you are, because I'm your 57-year-old neighbor, Jim. NSYNC hottie 503.  I cry-faced her right after she winky-faced all over me. Winky-faced on me. She didn't actually do a regular winky face. She did a semicolon beginning parenthesis, which is a winky frowny face. I don't even know if that's a real emotion.  I mean, I guess it's kind of like saying, hey, I'm unhappy, but you get it, right? Thank you.
