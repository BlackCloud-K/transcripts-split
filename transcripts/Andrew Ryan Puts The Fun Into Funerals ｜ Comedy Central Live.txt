 Do you know what I'm going to do? I'm going to move home back into the house. I'm going to take you to chemo. I'm going to look after you. We're going to get through this together. And she said, Andrew, you moving home will be worse than cancer. Tell you one thing I love about being Irish is this, right? Is that if funerals were an Olympic sport,  Ireland would win gold medals. We are the best at funerals. We are the best at funerals. Different countries, different cultures have different ways of doing funerals, right? Over in India, if you die in India, you could be cremated the same day. That's it. Gone. Cremated. Dead. Dead, dead. Like, 100% dead. Like, your phone battery has more f***ing life than you, right?  Here in the UK, it can be three or four weeks before you're buried. Three or four weeks. So you'd nearly forget about them. You'd wake up in the morning and go, jeez, I have to pick up the kids, I have to go to yoga. Bloody hell, I have to bury Steve, right?  Ireland, we're three days to bury somebody, three days, like a stag or a hen party, right? People meet, you haven't seen for a while, a lot of alcohol is involved, and by the end of it, somebody's missing, right? That's exactly how it works, right? And the reason why I bring this up is because I buried my mom recently, right? My mom died of cancer. My mom was a great woman. She died, she had terminal cancer. And I remember when I found out that she had cancer, she had a great sense of humor with it. And I think humor is very good when you're,  you know, you're dealing with this kind of stuff, right? My mom was a psychiatric nurse for 40 years, right? So she used to work in trauma. And every time, you know, she saw trauma, she'd always use humor to deal with it. And when I was living in London, I found out that she had terminal cancer. So I rang her up and I went, Jesus, man, I can't believe it. Like, do you know what I'm going to do? I'm going to move home, back into the house. I'm going to take you to chemo. I'm going to look after you. We're going to get through this together. And she said, Andrew, you moving home will be worse than cancer.  And my dad said, if he's coming home now, there'll be two cancers in the house. It's a mad thing to see, right? My mom spent the last three months of her life living in a hospice. Hospices are amazing places, right? With great staff and great care. Great living in a hospice as well. And I remember when I found out that she was going to the hospice, I didn't realize what to do or how do you deal with this kind of stuff. And I didn't even know where the hospice was. So do you know what I did? I Googled it to find out where it was. And I swear to God, I Googled it and there was over a hundred reviews.  Who the thinks it's a good idea to review a hospice? Like restaurants and hotels, I could totally deal with. But a hospice, I saw one review, my mate John went in for a week, never came out, two stars. I don't understand. What next, 20% off your next day? I don't think that's gonna happen.  I do miss my mum though. The thing about my mum is she was great. She was very liberal, very liberal and very traditional. And what she would do is she would teach me loads of things about life as well. And sometimes her liberal ideas and her forward thinking ways and her traditional ways as well, they never synced. They never synced as one idea. She was very progressive, but very traditional. One of her ideas was this. She believed that gay men in Ireland should be allowed to get married in the Catholic church. But she thinks one of them has to wear a white dress.  And you know what, guys? I agree with her. I think gay men should be allowed to get married in the place where they work. It's mad, innit?  But there's small things you do as you get a bit older and you're kind of like dealing with all that kind of stuff is that there's certain things that I pick up off my mum as well, which is great, was my mum used to leave the front door, go to the car, open the door and then go back up to the front door just to double check that it was locked. It's like what parents do, you know, mums do, right? I remember one day I was out in London, I lived here for 16 years and then I moved home when I got parole and I went back home, loved living here. I only fly over now just to use the NHS, but like, it's free to us, isn't it?  But the amazing thing about it was that I remember my mum rang me up one time and she said to me, are you out in London? I said, I am, yeah. Have you got the keys to my house in London? I said, yeah, I have them in my pocket. They're on my own keys. She goes, right, don't be bringing those keys out in London. I don't want my house keys in London. I said, why, what will happen? Well, somebody could rob them. I said, I'm in London.  You're in Ireland. Do you really think someone in London is going to pick up those house keys, figure out where you live, get on a plane, fly to Ireland and rob your house? She goes, you can't be too careful.  You know what the irony is, guys? You go to my mom's house, right? You walk up to the drive, go through the gates, straight up to the door. There's a step there, and on the left, there's a purple flower pot, right? It's just below the left window, okay? Right below the number. If you lift that flower pot, a set of keys right under there. My mom lives at 23 Carriglione Road, Carriglione County, Cork. Off you go. All you'll find in that house is a stainless stair lift and a house full of religious bigotry. Right, that's all it is. So, I'm only joking. Thank you.
