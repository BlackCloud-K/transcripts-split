 Are you a member of the Jacobs family? Because you're a right old cracker. Are you from Ireland? Because my penis is double. Hey, my mum would love you. Do you have Instagram? My mum always told me to follow my tweets. Is your name Durex? Because I've got a condom with your name on it. I know the alphabet. Hey, BC. Do you like raisins? How about dates?  Did it hurt when you fell from heaven? E-S-G-H-I-J-K-L-M-F-O-P. Are you on Spotify? Because you're one of the hottest singles around. Hello. That's always a good start, to say hello. Hey, are you a full moon? Because you're making my emotions peak. Q-R-S-T-U-V-W. One that's popular in the valleys we're in from, which is wanna neck. Wanna neck. You have to say it with aggression. Wanna neck.  Club was closing, the lights came on, and this guy came up to me and went, well, no one else wants us, should we just go? And I said, yes. Hey, dude, we're having a bottle lunch brunch, so would you want to be the first party? Do you like pizza? Because I want to pizza you, baby. XYZ.  Hold on, wait. I missed the D. You can get that later. Oh my God, oh my God, you dropped something. It's my number. I was messaging a man on a dating app and he said I looked like King Joffrey if he was not older. My vagina is like Scotland. People only visit America.  Where are you? Which I use on Grindr all the time. A pretty girl like you should be sitting here all alone looking so sad. I'd probably just be like, are you alright? And then panic and leave. Are you a parking ticket? Because you've got fine Britain all over you. I don't really chat people off because I don't have the confidence. So what I probably would do is I'd just stare at them just like this.  Unfortunately, people don't really talk to me at the bar. Hello, my name is X. Would you like to be my wife? I don't really believe in chat-up lines. I think it's best to just be authentic and just completely lose your mind when you're in front of someone attractive and just say something really just bad and completely tank and chat some more. Come back to mine. Not too fast, so fast. Do you want a crisp? And I say yes. And then we'd get married and that'd be it.  I get inboxes like, you're beautiful, can I come to your house? That's a chat up line. I'm not here to tell you that I like you because you already know that. I'm not here to tell you that I want you because you already know that. Let me tell you something you don't know. 079 834 962 148.  Get your coat darling, you've pulled. Have you been to jail because you stole my heart? Just something like that. Sex thing now is just my partner sending me lots of links to one bed flats on Rightmove. Occasionally if I want to spice things up I'll send her back a two bed flat that I think we can afford if her grandad chokes it.  And then they either come over and ask me to stop staring or I get kicked out. Me and my partner have been together since we were about 17. So my strategy is to meet them when they're seven. But crucially, you have to both be seven and then wait for about nine years before making do. The most effective chance at my nine hour is the one that my girlfriend used on me. She didn't ask me out. She just told me we were going out. I think we can both agree that we're going out now. And that's my best chat about it.
